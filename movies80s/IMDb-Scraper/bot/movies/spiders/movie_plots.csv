"The next day, Monroe's anxiety has turned into anger when he meets again with the three executives and tells them that he has viewed the final reel of the film and says that it is ""offensive, dishonest, and inhuman"". He leads the executives into a screening room to view the final reel: in it, Yates speaks to the camera, where it is days after their massacre of the Yacumo tribe; they are in a different part of the jungle, for the vegetation is different and there is no sign of the feared Yamamomo tribe. Suddenly, the group happens upon a young Yamamomo woman. Triumphantly and inexplicably, the men attack her, taking turns raping her while rolling in the mud of a nearby clearing; while one man holds her down, the other rapes her, and the third gleefully films the action. Faye tries to protest, but is held back by Anders. As Yates takes his turn to rape the terrified young woman, a Yamamomo warrior crouches in the grass yards away, watching the savage film crew's atrocities. The film then cuts to a riverside clearing, where the mud-covered Yates team find the same Yamamomo woman dead and vertically impaled to the ground with a 12-foot wooden pole exiting out of her mouth. Yates looks overjoyed and is told to look concerned for the camera. The epitome of hypocrisy, Yates talks about the profound disrespect the Yamamomos have for their women and that the woman was killed as a form of sexual punishment (it is not clear whether the woman was killed by her own people for being sexually violated by the Yates team, or if the Yates team killed the woman themselves in order to rig up this latest spectacular footage for their viewers back home). As a result of their actions, the vengeful Yamamomo emerge for a final 10-minute violent confrontation. In the jungle, the group is surrounded by dozens of Yamamomo warriors throwing spears and shooting arrows at them. Anders fights them by rashly shooting at several of them, while Yates (deranged to the end) continues filming, saying the footage is beautiful. Anders is felled by a spear as Yates continues filming. Anders' dead body is dragged away by the Yamamomo, where they castrate him, behead him and hack him apart before cooking his remains and eating them. Faye is next; she is grabbed by several Yamamomo warriors, where she is stripped, gang raped, and also beheaded and mutilated by the vengeful warriors. It is not long before Yates and Mark pay the price for their own indiscretions when the warriors spot Yates still filming them and attack. Yates is attacked and falls to the ground, his camera still rolling as it drops from his hands, capturing his own death in horrifying close-up. In a fitting touch of irony, the last thing which his dying eyes see is the same camera lens which he and his crew used to capture the images of death and mayhem...which, in fact, they were all responsible for."

The marshal then invites Tom to his office to discuss the contents of a letter he received from Montana. He tells Tom of a job offer in Montana to police cattle rustlers, then compliments Tom's way with a rifle, adding that the shooter killed Jimmy from a distance of 213 feet. Tom says his rifle is not capable of making such a clean shot, but Joe disagrees. Tom replies if he did make the shot it would be the best of his career, and his dirtiest trick. Marshal Belle does not get the confession he anticipated, and Tom leaves. Later, Sheriff Sam Creedmore and his deputy, Earl Proctor, arrest Tom for the murder of Jimmy Nolt."
"A philosophical and poetic portrait of the famous (or maybe infamous?) Baron Munchhausen. His crazy, yet very merriment, stories, views and behavior is what sets him apart from others. He becomes alienated from the society that failed to grasp his brilliance. In fact, his brilliance is what underlines the faults with the society itself. It's a beautiful yet tragic story that is filled with dense and intellectual dialogue."
An escaped convict plays the occupants of a remote home against one another for his own sadistic pleasure while searching for the loot he buried there following a previous robbery.
"Late 1901, South Africa. Lieutenants Harry ""Breaker"" Morant, Peter Handcock and George Witton are senior officers of the Bushveldt Carbineers, part of the Australian Army under the command of the British Army in the Boer War. The Carbineers' reason for being is largely to battle the loose collection of Boer guerrillas who are not part of the Boer army, but who are fighting against the British military regardless. The three are facing a collective court martial, for Morant allegedly ordering, as the officer in charge, the execution of six Boer prisoners, Witton allegedly killing one of those six before they were to be executed, and Handcock's alleged associated killing of a German missionary, Reverend Daniel Heese. Morant and Witton admit to their killings, but Morant, an ex-pat Brit with a poetic streak, claims that it was on an order issued indirectly by Lord Kitchener through his friend and former commanding officer, now deceased Captain Simon Hunt, and Witton, the young somewhat naive officer, claims he killed in self-defense as the prisoner charged him. And the charge against Handcock, the brash cocky one, is all circumstantial as there are no eyewitnesses. In reality, all charges were issued by Kitchener, using the three as scapegoats in a measure of political expediency to end the war, not caring that convictions could and probably will lead to sentences of execution. The British military stacking the decks against the three is further demonstrated by prosecutor Captain Alfred Taylor having six weeks to prepare, while defense attorney Major J.F. Thomas only having one day, in addition to Thomas having no trial experience, let alone no court martial experience. Regardless, a defiant Thomas vows to find out the truth and to defend his clients to the best of his abilities, which is better than most expect."

"Julian Kaye is a high end Los Angeles based male prostitute, his clientele comprised almost solely of older well appointed women. He does well financially with all the material trappings of wealth. He got his start working for Anne, who largely taught him the ropes of the business. While she still procures some of his clients on a 60/40 split, Julian drums up most of his own business on a 100 percent take, that business either by word of mouth or prowling the upscale hotel bars for lonely foreign female tourists, he fluent in six languages to be able to make those contacts. Despite Anne's objections to him going freelance, he went this route to have some control in what he still sees as a somewhat personal matter of with who he sleeps. He does not do gay business and stays away from quick tricks and kink, which is why he is so peeved upon finding the kink wants of clients the Rheimans, this job which he does as last minute replacement as a favor for a pimp acquaintance named Leon. It is during one of his cruises through a hotel bar that Julian meets Michelle Stratton. Despite she not being the potential client he thought she was as she is a married local waiting for a friend as opposed to a lonely foreign tourist, she nonetheless searches him out later for sex. They begin a relationship, for her he being someone to fill the physical and emotional void in her own marriage to her largely absent husband. Julian later discovers that her husband is Senator Charles Stratton, with the emotional void in their marriage being that he treats her more as a political prop than a wife. Julian's life starts to go sour when Judy Rheiman is found viciously murdered during what appears to be one of those rough sex acts the Rheimans requested from him. A suspect in the murder, Julian admits to one of the investigators, LAPD Vice Detective Joe Sunday, that he did have rough sex with Judy Rheiman in a previous encounter, but that he was with another client at the time of the murder. As discretion is part and parcel of the business, Julian's wealthy client, Lisa Williams, fails to corroborate his alibi, while Julian slowly begins to believe that someone is trying to frame him. With news spreading as to Julian's involvement in the murder, he becomes an untouchable property. While Julian goes on a desperate search for who is framing him and why so as to save not only his livelihood but his life, Michelle, who is beginning to have true feelings for him, has to decide how far she will go to help him at the risk of her own standing in the community, with Julian conversely having to decide how much he is willing to have her risk of her life to help him."

Two weeks earlier, Peter had mentioned to Mogens that he was having homicidal thoughts of killing his own wife, Katarina Egermann (Christine Buchegger), despite the two loving each other in their own way, including having a symbiotic sex life.

"Senior Patrol Agent Jackson and the young boy are murdered by Hotchkiss, a ruthless alien smuggler, also called ""the Marine"" by the aliens, portrayed by (Ed Harris). The murders take place when a truckload of illegal aliens being smuggled by Hotchkiss is stopped by Senior Patrol Agent Jackson while on routine road patrol. The truck has boxes of tomatoes on top of a hidden roof on the back of the truck. Under the roof is a hidden compartment containing the load of illegal aliens. Hotchkiss shoots ""Scooter"" from a concealed position in the back of the truck with a sawed-off shotgun at close range. The Mexican boy is badly wounded by stray buck shot so Hotchkiss finishes him off with another blast from his shotgun. Hotchkiss drags the bodies into the bushes along the side of the road and conceals the Border Patrol sedan in the same bushes. The other alien smuggler driving the truck with Hotchkiss becomes very nervous about the murders so Hotchkiss later kills him to keep him silent after they drop off the load of illegal aliens at a local fruit ranch, owned by well to do fruit farmer Carl Richards, and used as a front to smuggle aliens. Hotchkiss later abandons the truck used to smuggle the aliens along a rural road. Hotchkiss leaves the body of the other alien smuggler who was driving the truck the night of the murders, along with the truck, and conceals some small bags of marijuana in the truck to make it appear to be a drug smuggler's vehicle.

These particular prints were made by a pair of military style boots with some odd markings in the soles. One of a veteran Border Patrol Agent's professional skills is ""sign-cutting."" ""Sign-cutting"" is the skill to examine, analyze, and interpret tracks and marks made in the ground. Patrol Agents use this skill to track groups of illegal aliens crossing the border. Maynard has Fantes take the tomatoes to the Agriculture department of a nearby university for analysis. The F.B.I. is called to investigate. The F.B.I. has primary juridiction investigating the murder of any federal agents. A couple of days later the abandoned truck is found with the drugs. The F.B.I. agents investigating the murders wrongly conclude that Agent ""Scooter"" Jackson stopped some drug smugglers that night and was shot because of it. Hotchkiss is running a sophisticated and highly profitable alien smuggling operation between Mexico and the United States. Maynard and Fantes start checking the trails in the hills that the smugglers use to bring in illegal aliens and drugs. They find the same military boot prints along a trail where a Border Patrol electronic ground sensor has been dug up and disabled. Hotchkiss is a former U.S. Marine who had been trained on such equipment while in the Marine Corps. He discovered the sensor and disabled it on a prior smuggling run."
"BNW is one of many ""future world"" (aka dystopian0 novels written about a future where mankind is shackled and yet believes itself to be free and conditioned therefore to be perpetually ""happy"" - in this case using a readily available drug known as ""soma""...

"As the movie opens, Cheech & Chong are siphoning gas from a tow truck to fill the tank of their ""borrowed"" car. As they drive away, Chong rolls and lights up a joint, igniting the gas fumes and causing an explosion in the car. Cheech is dropped off at a movie studio to ask a girlfriend for clean clothes, claiming his state was caused by rescuing a baby from a fire. Meanwhile, Chong returns the car to their prudish neighbor, resulting in a confrontation as the neighbor rants. Chong returns his sentiments by shooting exhaust fumes out of the house window, killing the neighbor's rose bushes. After smoking up, Chong plugs in his guitar and starts wailing away loudly, annoying the entire neighborhood. Cheech arrives, barely managing to pull the power on the amplifier. Cheech drives Chong to pick up a urine sample for his probation officer (last time, he used an unwashed mayonnaise jar; this time, his sister's urine, and she's pregnant!). While driving down the street, Cheech swerves the van causing the urine to splash all over Chong. Chong pulls out a large bag of what appears to be cocaine, refusing to share until Cheech asks to just ""smell"" it. Chong shoves the bag in Cheech's face, revealing it to be a bag of his laundry soap. Cheech grabs and drinks from the urine sample, spits it out, and Chong hands the urine to him again! The next morning, Cheech awakens to find the van has been stolen. The phone rings, Chong answers and hands it to Cheech, only to find that Cheech has been fired and that his employer has retrieved the van.

The two break into another room through a window, make their way to Red's room, and successfully grab Red's luggage. Meanwhile, Pee Wee has called the police and while leaving, Red records the police sirens and bullhorn comments on his boombox. The two end up at a brothel and, as they're leaving, Red plays the police sounds on his boombox, emptying the brothel completely, including a tied-up girl. She takes them to the home of her ""trick"" and before long, all of them, save Cheech, end up in a comedy club. Meanwhile, Cheech has fallen asleep waiting for Donna, the office worker, dreaming vividly of her. Back at the comedy club, Pee Wee Herman shows up and a riot ensues. As Red & Chong leave, Chong complains that they left the herb behind. Red takes Chong to one of his marijuana fields to get more with the police in hot pursuit. The police set off the booby-traps as Red and Chong are abducted by aliens. Back at the house, Donna shows up while Cheech is dreaming that the neighbor has interrupted his fun. He shouts out in his sleep ""Get out! Get the f*** out, you f*** a**hole!"" Donna, thinking he's yelling through the door at her, leaves angrily. Cheech falls back asleep, continuing to dream. Chong appears in the dream as a warlord and, upon awakening, realizes that Chong is now home, wearing a horned helmet, and holding a vial of ""space coke."" Cheech samples the coke and goes into a rage, tearing a hole in the side of the house and doing the same to the neighbor's house. The movie ends with Cheech & Chong flying high into the air to the great doobie in the sky."
"Cathy arrives home, but the school bus is detained somewhere. Sheriff Billy Hart (Gil Rogers) finds the bus haphazardly parked along the side of the road, apparently abandoned in a hurry, with no sign of the children or the bus driver. Hart pays a visit to the home of Tommy Button, one of the children on the bus. Tommy lives with his mother, Leslie (Suzanne Barnes), and her female lover, Dr. Joyce Gould (Michelle Le Mothe). Leslie apparently spends her life dazed and heavily medicated, while Dr. Gould is hostile toward the sheriff for no good reason. She accompanies him to the site of the abandoned bus, where she finds Tommy's things on board. When Hart departs, Joyce goes to walk home when she spots a figure standing in a nearby cemetery. She recognizes it as Tommy, just as it disappears among the gravestones. She rushes up into the cemetery, where she stumbles across the horribly mutilated body of the bus driver; he seems to have been burned from within his clothes, his flesh horribly charred and disfigured. Suddenly Tommy appears behind Joyce, his fingernails black. Relieved, she sweeps him into a reassuring hug, suddenly screaming in agony as her flesh begins to char. Tommy's hands are roasting Joyce alive, and her burnt body falls beside that of the bus driver."

"Director Jules Dassin, once shunned by Hollywood for being accused
of ""un-American activities,"" had already worked for nearly thirty
years in Europe before making this Canadian drama about an elderly
painter and a sixteen-year-old teen. Richard Burton delivers as a
convincingly up-tight artist abandoned by his muse for the last ten
years. After he meets Sarah (Tatum O'Neal on the wan from her 1973
Oscar as ""Best Supporting Actress""), the muse begins to stir once
more. The two disparate souls meet at a soft-core film (Sarah's
friends dared her into seeing the flic), and an uneasy, non-sexual
relationship starts. But even though the artist discovers that his
muse is not totally defunct, that is a difficult trade-off for dealing
with Sarah's romantic inclinations. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie

"Coal Miner's Daughter opens with Loretta Webb (Sissy Spacek) riding a mule to the coal mine to meet her Daddy when he completes his shift. As the opening credits continue, the film shows some coal miners deep in a Kentucky coal mine where one yells ""fire in the hole,"" which is followed by an explosion. Then the film switches to Doolittle Lynn (Tommy Lee Jones), who is dressed in his Army uniform, driving a jeep with a blonde girl sitting next to him. Doolittle talks to several of the miners in front of the company store bragging about his beat-up jeep. He cons them into betting he can't climb a heap of red dog (a hill of mining trash) in his jeep. Ted Webb (Levon Helm), Loretty, as he calls her, and Herman, a younger brother, enter the company store where Ted asks the storekeeper if his Sears Roebuck order has arrived. While the storekeeper fetches Ted's order, Doolittle coaxes his jeep up the trash heap and wins the bet. When the Webbs return home to their rundown cabin in Butcher Holler, we meet Loretta's mother, Clary (Phyllis Boyens), and the rest of the Webb brood: eight children who range in age from infancy to age thirteen.
Meanwhile Doolittle hikes up the mountain to see his moonshine making friend, Lee Dollarhide (William Sanderson). Doo, as Lee calls him, had worked for Lee selling moonshine to the miners before he went into the Army. Lee admits to the rumors that he steals from the moonshiners over at Greasy Creek when his own supply runs low. He offers to go fifty-fifty if Doo will help him with his moonshine business. Lee reminds his friend that men born in the mountains of eastern Kentucky have three choices: ""coal mine, moonshine or movin' on down the line."" Back at the Webb cabin, Daddy Webb presents the children with the shoes he had ordered from Sears Roebuck (in the summer they went barefooted, but in the winter they get shoes). On this occasion Loretta receives a dress in addition to shoes; she gets something extra, Ted explains, because she's gettin to be a woman. The first time in the film that Loretta sings she takes her youngest sibling out onto the porch and sings the traditional mountain song, ""In the Pines,"" a cappella. While she's out there, Lee starts another run on Greasy Creek and is shot by one of his moonshine competitors. Soon Doo and his Pa lead Lee's mule with his body draped over it past the Webb home. Doo's Pa is glad his son wasn't working for Lee or he would likely be draped over the mule beside his friend.
The scene changes to a community gathering where several of the youngsters are playing musical chairs while a string band plays. After the game there is a pie auction, for which Doo volunteers to be the auctioneer. When it comes time to auction Loretta's chocolate pie, Doo and another young man compete to be the highest bidder. Doo finally wins for $5. While the crowd square dances, Doo tries a bite of Loretta's pie and immediately spits it out. She had put salt instead of sugar in her pie by mistake. Later, he offers her a ride in his jeep, but she won't accept. So, he walks her home. During the walk Doo talks about how much he learned about the outside world while he was in the Army. It made him realize he doesn't want to be a coal miner. When they get to her cabin, he kisses her good night (it was her first kiss). As he's leaving he promises to bring his jeep up to her cabin and take her for a ride, but she doesn't think he can get it up the holler. The next morning, true to his word, Doo drives his jeep up the holler to take Loretta for a ride - a wild ride. When Doo almost plunges the jeep off an embankment, he kisses Loretta. She is breathless partly from the kiss, but also from the wild ride. Doo tells her, ""That's the way youre supposed to feel when youre in love."" When she returns home after dark, her Daddy whips her like she was a little girl and tells her to stay away from Doo. Later, when Loretta and her father go to a shallow mine for coal for the family to burn, he talks to her about her relationship with Doo; she's not even fourteen and he's a wild grown-up. He begs his ""shinin' pride"" not to throw her young years away, but she loves Doo and they want to get married. Back at the cabin while the family is listening to the Grand Ole Opry on their battery-powered radio, Ted encourages his wife, Clary, to do her squaw dance. Ted sings along with Bill Monroe's ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"" while Clary dances. While everybody is watching and listening, Doo knocks on the door, but they don't hear him, so he comes in anyway. Once they realize he's in the cabin, Clary stops dancing and goes into another room and Ted turns off the radio and leaves the cabin. Once Loretta and Doo are alone, he shows her the money he had saved from his Army paychecks. He reminds her that the next day is their anniversary (he doesn't say anniversary of what), so he thinks it would be good time to get married. Loretta likes the idea, but tells him to ask her Daddy, who tells him to ask Clary, who tells him to ask Ted - back and forth. Finally, Doo waits until they are in bed and goes into their bedroom to ask them both at the same time. Ted asks him to promise two things: don't hit her and don't take her far away from home. Doo promises. The next day at their wedding there are two ladies sitting in the pews of the rustic church. Ted finally walks in the back door, stands there long enough to answer ""I do"" when the preacher asks who gives this woman to be married to this man, and then leaves. They don't have wedding rings to exchange. At the motel on their wedding night, it is freezing. Loretta puts her night gown on over her other clothes, partly because she's so cold but also because she's afraid of sex. Doo forces himself on her, which frightens and disgusts her. The next morning she won't go into the adjoining restaurant because she's sure people will stare and know what they've been doing. Doo tells her she better get used to it. When she says, ""I ain't gonna get used to you gettin' on me and sweatin' like an ol' pig,"" Doo breaks one of the promises he had made her Daddy; he slaps her. Doo goes to work at the coal mine while Loretta tries to learn how to be a house wife. Doo loses his patience with her lousy cooking, her lack of house cleaning and her innocence about how to love her man, so he gives her a book, ""Sex for Newlyweds."" In the following scene, Loretta trudges up the holler towards her folks' cabin; Doo has thrown her out. When her Daddy says, ""I believe married life's makin' you fat, girl,"" her mother immediately realizes her daughter is pregnant. Loretta goes to the doctor and sure enough, before her fourteenth birthday, she is pregnant. When she leaves the doctor's office, she sees a girl flirting with Doo so she picks up a stick and runs her off. Doo tells Loretta he's leaving Kentucky. He's going to Washington (state) to find a job; he refuses to be buried alive in the coal mine. He plans to send for her as soon as he saves enough money. She reminds him of his promise not to take her far away from home. Well, he says, she'll just have to choose which is more important: being her Daddy's daughter or his wife. He gives her a ride home and on the way she tells him she's going to have a baby. He laughs and says, ""You know, you might have found something that you know how to do."" Months later Loretta receives a letter from Doo with enough money for the trip to Washington. The film skips ahead to Loretta's life in Washington. She's now the seventeen-year-old mother of four. Doo, who is now known as ""Mooney"" because of his moonshine days back in Kentucky, works as a logger. One night Loretta sings the children to sleep with a song about the sinking of the Titanic. Mooney listens intently. Afterwards, he asks what she'd like for her anniversary present. She reminds him she still doesnt have a wedding ring. Mooney goes to the local pawn shop to look for an anniversary present. He comes home late that evening drunk with a guitar for her gift. Even though she can't play it, he bought her a guitar because he likes the way she sings. While she sits on the front porch washing clothes in a decrepit washing machine, she picks out the chords and sings ""Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?"" As she improves, she makes her kids sit and listen and also sings while Mooney washes the supper dishes.
Mooney suggests they get a babysitter and go honky-tonkin'. On Saturday night they go to the local Grange Hall. Mooney seems to have something on his mind and Loretta thinks he must be going to finally give her a ring. Instead, Mooney talks to the bandleader about auditioning Loretta to sing with his band. When she realizes what her husband is doing, she runs to the bathroom. He follows and finally talks her into the audition. The next week Loretta is introduced as the new girl singer of the Westerneers. At first, she sings ""There He Goes,"" a song popularized by Patsy Cline, very timidly, but quickly loses her inhibitions and performs the song so well that the audience applauds lustily. While she is gardening one day, she makes up her first original song, ""I'm a Honky Tonk Girl."" Mooney wants Loretta to cut a record, so they go to a small local recording studio. After she flubs a take, Mooney places the kids in the studio so she can sing to them like she does at home. After a few bars, the recording engineer stops the session to get more and better pickers because ""that little lady sings her hind end off."" Back home, Mooney takes a publicity photo with their bedspread as the backdrop. After work, he stays up all night addressing envelopes with Loretta's photo and her record to country DJs. Mooney and Loretta don't have a telephone, so a neighbor comes to tell Loretta she has a long distance emergency phone call - her Daddy has died. Back in Kentucky for the funeral, friends and family sing ""Amazing Grace"" at the wake. It took Loretta quite a while to recover from her Daddy's death. Mooney finally convinces her if she wants to be a singer they have to see DJs in person to make certain they play her record. Grandma keeps the kids while they travel from station to station in eastern Kentucky. One of them claims to have received her record, played it and it flopped, but they find the envelope they sent unopened. She rants so vociferously, the DJ relents and plays it. On an interview segment a DJ tells her she has to pay her dues before she can sing on the Opry. Despite all the obstacles, ""I'm a Honky Tonk Girl"" becomes a hit. After an all-night drive, Loretta wakes to find they're parked in front of the Ryman Auditorium, the home of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. She's in awe. On her first appearance on the Opry, Ernest Tubb (himself) opens the show by singing ""Walkin' the Floor Over You."" Loretta is scared; she doesn't think she belongs on such a prestigious stage; she hasn't suffered enough to be this far this fast. (The film shows a glimpse of two country music legends, Minnie Pearl and Roy Acuff, in the wings of the theater.) Tubb introduces Loretta who sings ""I'm a Honky Tonk Girl."" After her performance, Tubb invites her to return the following week. After Loretta appeared on the Opry seventeen straight weeks, she sings ""I Fall to Pieces"" at Ernest Tubb's Record Shop in downtown Nashville. During an instrumental break, she dedicates the song to Patsy Cline, who made it a hit. She tells the listening audience that Patsy is in the hospital recovering from a car wreck. Afterward, Charlie Dick (Bob Hannah), Patsy's husband, meets them outside and tells Loretta that Patsy (Beverly DAngelo) would like to meet her. Loretta accompanies Charlie to the hospital and she and Patsy become bosom buddies. When Patsy returns to the Opry, she sings ""Sweet Dreams"" while Loretta watches from the wings. Later on Patsy's tour bus on the way to an appearance at a fair, Patsy sings a little of Kitty Wells' hit ""It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels."" In the pouring rain, Patsy and Loretta sing a duet of ""Back in Baby's Arms"" while each holds an umbrella. After the show Loretta catches Mooney in the back seat of a car with a carnival floozie. She drags him out and threatens that she better never catch him with trash like that again. Later, on the bus she writes the song ""You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)"" about that incident. After a shopping trip with Patsy, Mooney and Loretta fight over her use of makeup (he doesn't like it and never has). Loretta hits his hand with her purse and then drives away with Charlie and Patsy. When Mooney comes home late, his hand is all bandaged. He's decided to get a job (he feels like a kept man and that was a serious male ego problem in the country community if not in the nation at large). She offers to quit if her being the bread winner is going to cause them to split. During their conversation, he finally gives her a wedding ring. Mooney gets a job as a mechanic in a garage where we hear Loretta sing ""You Ain't Woman Enough"" over the radio. Loretta visits Patsy and tells her she's pregnant again, but she doesn't want this baby. Patsy cheers her up by promising to give her the biggest baby shower in Nashville. Then Patsy gives her a box of her old maternity clothes. Patsy is leaving for a benefit performance in Kansas City, but she promises to call when she returns on Monday and they'll go shopping. Loretta wakes on Monday morning to the sounds of Patsy's voice singing ""Sweet Dreams"" on the radio. The announcer speaks over her singing and says, ""You're listening to a tribute to the late Patsy Cline, tragically killed early this morning in a plane crash near Dyersburg, Tennessee."" In the next scene, Loretta has given birth to twin girls that she names Peggy and Patsy (of course, Patsy is named after Patsy Cline). Back on stage at the Opry, Loretta sings ""You're Lookin' at Country."" As the song continues, she tours, writes songs on her tour bus, and signs autographs. The Opry announcer introduces her as having twenty-one No. 1 records. While she sings ""Sweet Dreams,"" Mooney drives his jeep up to their mansion in Hurricane Hills, Tennessee and later bathes the twins. While she sings ""You Ain't Woman Enough"" we see her touring again and spending lonely nights in hotel rooms. When the Opry announcer introduces her as the first lady of country music, she sings ""Your Squaw Is on the Warpath,"" while Mooney and the twins watch on TV. Her relentless schedule finally catches up with her. She's having throbbing headaches and medicine doesn't help. She wants Mooney on the road with her to take care of her. Out on the road again, Loretta sings ""Lovin' Country Style."" Later, she can't remember the lyrics to a new song, ""One's on the Way,"" so one of her band members feeds the lyrics to her, but they soon give up and switch to the more familiar ""You Ain't Woman Enough."" At her next concert, she doesn't want to go on, but Doo convinces her not to let her fans down. When she goes on stage, she doesn't come in after the band plays the introduction for her first song. Instead, she talks to the audience - her friends and fans and tells them that Patsy told her, ""you got to run your own life,"" but she feels like her life is running her. As she walks off the stage she collapses into her husband's arms (she suffered a nervous breakdown brought on by physical exhaustion and marital stress - her marriage miraculously survived).
After her recuperation back at their ranch, she returns to the Opry and sings ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" which is her very autobiographical song. That song segues into the closing credits which recaps scenes from the film. Further into the closing credits, we hear excerpts from ""One's on the Way,"" ""I'm a Honky Tonk Girl,"" ""You Ain't Woman Enough,"" ""You're Lookin' at Country,"" ""Fist City,"" ""Your Squaw Is On the Warpath,"" and ""Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)."""

"At the concert hall entrance, Heidi meets hunky semifinalist Girolamo ""Jerry"" DiSalvo (Joseph Cali) from the Bronx. He tries to attach himself to her, and when she politely declines, he tags along with the next semifinalist to arrive: Mitzi (Elaine Welton Hill), telling her he discovered his piano talent while at the house of corrections. Inside the building, Heidi is pleased to see Paul, with whom she had played a piano duet at Tanglewood years before, but Paul seems to show little interest in her. Paul excuses himself to use the restroom and spends a few seconds there reminding himself--addressing his image in the mirror--that the girl everybody called Joanie might eat into his concentration on the competition. The pianists rehearse for the semifinals. Mark Landau (Adam Stern) from Canada boots Mitzi from a rehearsal room in the concert hall and tunes the piano with his own supplies before he practices. Michael Humphries (Ty Henderson), a former Delaware resident living in Italy, has a piano in a swank hotel room and practices in the nude. At the consulate, Tatiana is frustrated while rehearsing a difficult passage in her concerto and storms away while her teacher scolds her.

Also with Phil is the book which contains all the information Jack was going to turn over. Gloria and Phil have an antagonistic relationship, not so much for who they are but what they are, Phil a kid, and Gloria a strange white woman who hates kids. As an ex-mistress of a mobster, Gloria learns that the people that killed the Dawns are old friends of hers. As Gloria and Phil go on the run both from the mob and from the authorities (who believe she kidnapped Phil) throughout New York City, Gloria has to come up with a plan on how best to save themselves, which is not easy because of their love/hate relationship and the fact that precocious Phil has a mind of his own. That plan includes what to do with the book, but more importantly how to save Phil as the mob would still be after him regardless of the book just in case he knows something about his father's dealings. All through their ordeal, Gloria is not averse to shooting to kill, especially if those who she is trying to kill are trying to kill her and Phil first."

"Rude Boy is part documentary and part short film centering on punk band, The Clash and one of their ""roadies""(he's really more of a tag along as he is somewhat lazy and doesnt appear to have any technical knowledge on setting up or fixing sound or music equipment.) by the name of Ray Gange, who is actually one of the writers and directors of the film. The film takes place between the bands release of their explosive debut album and its follow up, the very underrated, ""Give 'Em Enough Rope""(an album that has largly been cast aside solely because of its more radio friendly production brought about by Sandy Pearlman who was seen as unfit to work with a a punk band because he had previously worked with bands such as Blue Oyster Cult.)
Ray the roadie plays the foil by being somewhat dim and spouting off knee jerk conservative statements to which the rest of the band, in particular, Joe Strummer, can respond and react to. The film captures the tension on the streets of London in the late 70s as economic disaster seems to loom overhead and many begin to look for scapegoats in the form of non white immigrants. The conservative political group, the National Front takes this cue to fan the fires of race war in the streets and groups like The Clash both observed and addressed these issues in their music at a time when no other bands would outside of the punk music scene. The film features live footage from some very legendary shows such as the rock against racism rally held in Victoria Park and attended by over 100,000 people. The Clash is seen on camera at its peak and the film offers some rare opportunities to see the band in a more candid setting than on stage or in a planned interview. a must see for fans of punk rock and really music in general."

"Built in 1907, the posh, grand and secluded Overlook Hotel, located in the mountains of Colorado, closes for the winter months as it was never designed as a ski resort, that seclusion and isolation which has always been its attraction for its upscale guests and which makes it largely inaccessible in the snowy winter. Having recently moved from Vermont to Boulder with his wife Wendy and their adolescent son Danny, former schoolteacher Jack Torrance has just accepted the five month job as the Overlook's winter caretaker in wanting uninterrupted solitude to start his new career as a writer. In accepting the job, Jack was not deterred in knowing of the incident ten years ago when the then hotel GM Charles Grady, acting as that season's winter caretaker, developed a severe case of cabin fever and ended up gruesomely killing his wife and two daughters before killing himself. Beyond a recent undiagnosed collapse experienced by Danny which may be an issue if it happens again at the hotel, Wendy is looking forward to this five month getaway. While Danny indirectly states he doesn't want to go, Wendy is not concerned about his emotional well being in this new situation as he, out of circumstance, has often been on his own without other children around, which has long ago led to him creating an imaginary friend named Tony who lives in Danny's mouth. When the Torrances arrive at the Overlook on October 30th, its last day of operation before they take over for the winter, Danny learns that there is someone at the hotel who knows his secret abilities in association to Tony's true nature. After the regular staff leaves for the winter and as winter truly sets in, the isolation of the resort begins to show itself. The question becomes which of the often battling powers in this isolation will ultimately come out on top: Wendy's mortal fortitude, Danny's secret ability which he learns is called the shining, or the hotel's associated secrets which are slowly overtaking Jack."

"The Institute for Advanced Concepts, headed by Dr. Carl Becker along with four fellow scientists, has unlimited resources secretly funded by the highest powers to conduct unfettered research to control and manipulate the world in all aspects. Their next brainchild of a project is to brainwash someone in believing that he is an alien and unleash him into the world to see what happens. That brainwashing includes making him believe that his ""mother"" produced him in the form of a human, much like one would produce a toaster. Who they choose is Psychology professor Dr. Simon Mendelssohn, partly because he was a foundling whose true origins no one can question. They are able to lure him to the Institute under the guise of being able to conduct his own research, his fascination with but little understanding of sensory deprivation which they are further able to capitalize on in the brainwashing process. To further ensure that Simon complies, they plan on using their seductive female ""associate"", Dr. Cynthia Mallory, to act as a Juliet operative. Unleashing Simon the alien into the world, they will have to contend with his casual girlfriend, Lisa, a Music professor at the same New York City college, she who may have her own ways of proving that Simon is not the alien he and they assert he is."

"Unbeknownst to Lucky, Chuck has planted an explosive in one of the Duesenberg's front tires to make the car's tumble off the bridge look more realistic. Lucky panics everyone by starting the scene too early. (He's in the Duesenberg with the windows rolled up and mistakes a question about the on-board camera for his cue.) The car goes into the water when Chuck triggers the exploding tire, and Lucky scrambles to reach Nina in the trunk -- until he happens to look up out of the sinking car's rear window to see Nina with Eli on the bridge. Lucky emerges, gasping, from the river and notices that there were divers in the water with him all the time. Nina tells him that she was found in the trunk hours before the shoot, and Eli told her that Lucky had changed his mind and decided to do the stunt. Lucky, of course, had done no such thing, but Nina's so pleased that he and Eli have made up that he doesn't set her straight. Eli, descending as usual from heaven on his crane, explains that he wouldn't let Lucky run off thinking that Eli was trying to kill him (and not incidentally leaving the film incomplete). The best way to convince Lucky of Eli's good will, Eli felt, was to make sure Lucky got through the stunt in one piece. Lucky, though furious -- not for the first time -- at Eli's high-handed manipulations, is amused in spite of himself and giddy with relief at surviving.

Close to a year later, Elliot Rosen, who has been leading a strike force on the matter for the Justice Department, believes liquor wholesaler Michael Gallagher is responsible for Diaz's disappearance despite having no evidence and Michael on the surface being ""clean"". Rosen's belief stems from Michael having taken over his business on the death of his crooked father, Tommy Gallagher, a known bootlegger who had kept the union off the Miami docks for years. Megan Carter, a reporter for the Miami Standard who is working the Diaz story, has a personal connection to the strike force through FBI agent Bob Waddell, a member of the strike force and Megan's now ex-boyfriend. Megan learns that the strike force has placed Michael under investigation by reading the file they have on Michael that Rosen ""conveniently"" leaves on his desk while he leaves his office for a short period leaving Megan there, alone. Rosen wanted the information leaked to the press so that Michael could eventually be squeezed for information; Megan naively obliges what Rosen wants by writing a story as such. The front page story incenses Michael, who was not interviewed before the story went to press. Although the story is accurate in the way the facts are presented, there is still no proof Michael has done anything illegal or wrong in any manner, but the story will still place him in a bad light as possibly being guilty of murder. Megan refuses to divulge the source for the story to Michael, who knows his business will be negatively affected. Michael does have an alibi for the time of Diaz's disappearance which he does not even bring up, the alibi involving time spent with a long time platonic friend, devout Catholic Teresa Peron.

First, she now becomes part of the story as Michael's girlfriend. And second, she may not be able to separate her role as Michael's girlfriend from that of reporter, she perhaps having to prioritize between the two."

One day, the henchmen of a local gangster boss named Torsillo come ashore in Amantido to initiate the construction a banana processing plant. Of course, Joe (in typical direct-approach manner) evicts the goons, who promptly return to their boss.
Torsillo finds out that Joe is trading bananas without a license and decides to exploit it. Upon his next delivery, Joe is apprehended by the police and given the choice of either acquiring a legal license or getting his boat taken away and himself arrested for illegal shipment. Joe travels to the nearest city, which to him is a new world, as he grew up in the rainforest. Unfamiliar with city life and only marginally literate, he falls prey to a con man named Manuel, who has a gift of the gab which has placed him in favor in several high positions, even with the country's President for his help in developing a remedy for a genetic defect in the Presidential family.
Eventually Joe meets Dorianne, an attractive singer, in a bar owned by Torsillo, where he gets a temporary job as a bouncer. Torsillo also runs into Joe personally time and again, and after having seen Joe easily finishing off five of his toughest goons, the gangster boss has taken to jumping out of the next window in a panic the instant he lays an eye on Joe.

Joe and Manuel promptly break out of prison and return to Amantido, where Joe proceeds to thrash a newly built casino and Torsillo's thugs. Afterwards the police arrive, but not to arrest Joe.

Todd enters the area near a workshop and stable area and sees Cropsy (whose horribly burned face is finally seen) holding the flamethrower. A flashback shows that Todd was one of the five campers who was responsible for the prank. Cropsy turns off the flamethrower, and Todd hears Alfred scream again. Cropsy reappears again in the shed and turns back on the flamethrower and tries to set Todd on fire while he swings at the maniac with the ax. As Cropsy is swinging the flames around, Alfred frees himself and stabs Cropsy in the back with the garden shears.

Back at the mine, Todd and Alfred begin to walk out of the mine when Cropsy revives and attacks Alfred.

"During the post-World War I era, Britons Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell are both naturally gifted fast sprinters, but approach running and how it fits into their respective lives differently. Harold, the son of a Lithuanian Jew, lives a somewhat-privileged life as a student at Cambridge and uses being the fastest to overcome what he sees as the obstacles he faces in life a Jew despite that privilege. In his words to paraphrase an old adage, he is often invited to the trough, but isn't allowed to drink. His running prowess does earn him the respect of his classmates, especially his running teammates, and to some extent the school administration, if only he maintains what they consider proper gentlemanly decorum, which isn't always the case in their minds. Eric Liddell, a Scot born to Christian missionaries in China, is a devout member of the Church of Scotland who hopes to eventually return to that missionary work. He sees running as a win-win: the notoriety of being fast gives him an added outlet to spread the word of God, while he sees his speed as being a gift from God, and he wants to run to honor God and that gift. This view does not sit well with his sister Jennie, who sees his running as only taking away time from his work to God. Harold and Eric's lives intersect in national races, but it is the 100-meter track event at the 1924 Paris Olympics which the two men and their supporters most anticipate. Beyond the fact that Americans Charles Paddock and Jackson Scholz are favored in the event, the much-anticipated head-to-head between Harold and Eric could be further shadowed by other issues, especially as it affects Eric's Christian beliefs."

An incident between the two which on the surface threatens to tear them even further apart instead blossoms into a friendship between the two. They begin to learn more and more about the other and their lives, which for Danny includes becoming a rabbi, solely as it is a several generations old family calling.

Professor Malter is a confirmed Zionist who believes in a secular Jewish state in Palestine, while Reb Saunders believes such thinking against Judaism, with only the Messiah being able to lead his people into such.

"CONTIENE SPOILERS
La película trata la historia de dos atracadores y ladrones de coches (el Mini y el Meca), que conocen a una chica (Ángela). Planean nuevos atracos para los que necesitan otro miembro en su pequeña banda, así que introducen en el grupo a un conocido de ellos (el Sebas). También se relacionan con una amiga de Ángela, María, pero que no participa en los atracos.
En los atracos, Ángela participa disfrazada de varón.
La película retrata el modus vivendi de los delincuentes, el consumo de drogas, su relación con la policía (como cuando pasean por el Cerro de los Ángeles en Getafe y les piden la documentación y se tienen que deshacer de la droga que llevan encima). De día duermen, cometen algún atraco con el que vivir y comprar droga, y por la noche, van a la discoteca a bailar y drogarse. No tienen responsabilidades, así que si en medio de un colocón de droga les apetece coger el coche y recorrer 500 Km para ir a la playa, lo hacen. Tampoco les importa conducir drogados o mientras fuman porros. El coche no es suyo, ya que es robado, el dinero que se gastan también es robado. Y si se les acaba, siempre pueden robar de nuevo.
Cuando no están drogados y tienen dinero, pueden parecer unos chicos normales que sólo quieren divertirse. Por ejemplo, salen a dar un paseo montados a caballo por el barrio de Villaverde Alto (de donde son originarios los actores en la vida real). Les advierten de que tengan cuidado con los caballos y de que no crucen la carretera con ellos. Y eso prometen, pero en cuanto están drogados, nada les importa, ni siquiera que se les escapen los caballos que les han prestado.
Aunque viven en Madrid, en los barrios pobres de la ciudad (Villaverde, Vallecas), no todos son originarios de Madrid. El Mini procede de un pueblo de Segovia, llamado Maderuelo. Lleva allí a Ángela a presentarle a su abuela. Pueden aparentar ser buenos chicos o buenas personas, ya que le regalan a su abuela una televisión grande y moderna (para la época). Pero no es más que el fruto de algún robo o comprada con el dinero de algún atraco.

"Eighty thousand years ago, a brutal Wagabou attack on a sleepy Ulam cave dwelling causes much death and injury. Naoh distinguishes himself in the attack, killing a couple of the gorilla-like Wagabou. Nevertheless, the attack, followed by wolf depredations, leads to the extinguishing of the Ulams' fire. Even the flame kept in a small bone and hide receptacle and guarded by a special fire-keeper, who flounders while slogging through a lake, is lost. The ragged survivors, in miserable conditions, send forth Naoh, Amoukar, and Gaw to find ""atra""--fire. A rival faction of the clan seeks to claim the receptacle and the quest for themselves, but an elder chief-figure restores it to Naoh. Crossing a savannah landscape, the three are treed by a pair of sabre-tooth cats. Trapped for some time, the men eat all the leaves of the perilously small tree before the cats leave. Continuing on, they hunger for meat, and Amoukar and Gaw quarrel. They see smoke in a distant forest, but arrive too late to capture the fire. Pawing through the ashes of the campfire, they find bones to gnaw, but stop in disgust as they uncover a humanoid skull. Stalking the cannibalistic Kzamma by the light of their campfire, they see two captive women (one is Ika, who we are soon to meet) hanging captive from a tree. While Amoukar and Gaw run a diversion, Naoh tries to steal fire, but ends up in a fight. He seriously injures two Kzamma, but not before being bitten in the groin. In the end, Naoh absconds with two fire sticks and rejoins his mates. They are soon approached by Ika. The men try to drive her off, but she follows, and eventually wins over Naoh by applying a vegetable poultice to his injured gonads while Amoukar and Gaw are off gathering gourds. The Kzamma have pursued, however, and are poised to attack in superior numbers when miraculously a herd of Wooly Mammoth enter the scene. Naoh wins the day when he approaches the head Mammoth and, supplicant, offers a handful of grass. The animal accepts the offering, and the herd drives off the Kzamma. That evening around the fire, the sexual tension is think. Amoukar makes a try for Ika, but she appeals to Naoh, who warns off Amoukar and--a fast healer--promptly mounts her himself, despite her screams and struggles, though the brief interlude seems to conclude in mutual satisfaction. The following day, Ika attempts to divert the men toward another route, but they ignore her. Later, Naoh seems on the verge of a discovering the stone age breakthrough of flint-knapping when a stone dislodged by Gaw hits Amoukar in the head; Ika's laughter is foreign and somewhat alarming to the men, who, we realize have not yet learned the art and luxury of laughter. The following morning, Ika runs off, and, later that day and to the disgust of his fellows, Naoh leads them in pursuit. They let him go on alone and, nearing Ikas village of mud and reed huts, Naoh bogs down in quicksand and is taken prisoner by her people, the Ivaka. Ika's more advanced people feed Naoh and watch laughing as he has sex with four of the plumper village girls. The following day, Naoh is moved to tears as he watches a demonstration of the wooden drill the villagers use to make fire. Meanwhile, Amoukar and Gaw, having gone in search of Naoh, are found in the quicksand. That night, Amoukar and Gaw escape with an armload of atlatls (another new technology) and with Naoh, whom they must club unconscious in order to bring along. Ika follows. Later, with loving looks, Naoh and Ika decorate one another with mud. Up a tree, Amoukar drops a rock onto Gaw's head, and all have a good laugh. Still later, Naoh mounts Ika but she soon turns onto her back and teaches him another position, to his delight. As this continues, Amoukar makes overtures to Gaw, but Gaw makes clear his refusal. Soon after, the four encounter their old Ulam rivals who challenged them at the outset of their quest. While Naoh and Amoukar reconnoiter, Gaw and Ika hang back at a cave; suddenly, a massive brown bear comes out of the darkness of the cave and mauls Gaw. As the others carry Gaw toward home and safety, the rival clansmen attack, demanding the fire the travelers carry with them. With their new stone-tipped spears and atlatls, they make short work of the Ulam ingrates, and even Ika getting in on the atlatl action. Returning to the main Ulam group, the people are overjoyed to see the travelers returning with fire. During the celebration, which takes place in the shallows of a lake, the original fire-keeper again falls with the receptacle into the water, extinguishing the flame. Naoh makes an oratory to a skeptical Ulam audience before sitting down with the drill to make fire. He soon becomes frustrated and Ika takes over, starting the fire and winning over the Ulam people in the process. That evening, as Amoukar regales his audience with tales of their epic quest and the injured Gaw enjoys the ministrations of a clanwoman around the roaring campfire, Naoh and Ikah sit side by side in the moonlight admiring her swelling tummy."

"The story takes place at the end of the 50s in Aarhus, Denmark and follows a group of children from the 7th to the 9th grade. What they experience are not the grand dramas of life, but the events they do experience affect them more powerfully than at any other time in their lives. The film centres around Elin, the prettiest and most mature girl in the class. She plays on these advantages more or less unconsciously. It makes the girls jealous and the boys unsure. Therefore she becomes the scapegoat for their unresolved sexual awareness. For Elin, this being frozen out of the once happy circle becomes a tragedy, also on account of being totally misunderstood by her old-fashioned parents. The other main character is Niels-Ole, the leading boy in the class, who arouses indignation by rejecting girls in his own class in favour of the younger and prettier girl, Majbritt. At the same time, this film is a light-hearted yet serious account of the beautiful difficult years between childhood and youth, based on the director Nils Malmros' own experiences as a schoolboy in Aarhus in the late 1950s."

"It's been over ten years since the end of WWII, and the West German economy is booming largely due to reconstruction. Straight-laced, refined, wealthy and regimented von Bohm is hired by Mayor Völker as the new Building Commissioner in his West German city, von Bohm new to the city. Kleinermans, von Bohm's predecessor, ran a lax, undisciplined building department, resulting in the major shrewd contractors, especially Schuckert, being able to sneak and bribe their way into building whatever they want. Schuckert's activities are despite Kleinermans and now von Bohm's assistant, Esslin, never having agreed with what is happening in the construction business in the city. Usually reserved von Bohm quickly falls for a young woman he meets named Marie-Louise. He is unaware of two fundamental aspects of her being. First, she is the daughter of the faithful Prussian housekeeper he has just hired, Frau Kummer. And second, although being a classically trained singer, Marie-Louise works largely as Lola, a performer at a sleazy cabaret, where the women also ply their trade upstairs at the whorehouse. Most of the bureaucrats and elected officials, including Esslin and Mayor Völker, know Lola as they frequent the cabaret and whorehouse, Esslin who even works as a drummer in the cabaret's band. Lola is largely married Schuckert's kept woman, he the biological father of Lola's now adolescent daughter, Marie, of which he is aware. Like most of her fellow whores, Lola doesn't much like her life, she yearning for respectability. She doesn't like false artifice, as she is ashamed of her own double life. As such, Marie-Louise dreams of a life with von Bohm, she and Esslin the only two people who know the entire situation between her and von Bohm. The question becomes what the repercussions are if von Bohm finds out about her life as Lola, those repercussions not only on their relationship but also the nature of the construction business in the city."
"Larry gets into the sets of the commercials. Jennifer controls the diverse rooms and moves them around. One of the sets resembles the White House. Senator Robert Harrison (Michael Hawkins or Giansborough) is making a speech; but actually, it's not him, but a digital version of himself. His eyes shine with an electronic blue light - suggesting that he's hypnotizing his viewers. Ironically, he's making a speech about personal freedom and responsibility, pro-environment, anti-corruption. Then, without continuity, there is a break and a commercial of Cindy's digital image advertising a cleaning liquid. Everybody laughs. The mustached man shoots Jennifer, thinking she was Larry. Jennifer manages to get back to the lab, even though she's badly hurt. Cindy tries to get the key to her handcuffs, but Jennifer wakes up for a second and pushes her aside. Renson enters the set as well: too many people in an enclosed space. Meanwhile, the audience laughs at the commercial of an elderly couple (Joseph G. Medalis & Estelle Omens) in bed. Larry hides inside a car. Outside, the audience sees the car and the mustached man moving around it, but with a model (Melissa Prophet) talking about the car in a commercial. The model has been added digitally. The audience also sees Larry using his gun, and the windshield breaking at gunpoint. Renson is also seen in the commercial. The next commercial is even weirder: the dead body of the mustached man is on top of a table, and around that table, two children (Allison Balson & Adam Farrar) and their parents (Dick Christie & Katherine De Hetre) talk about Oaties cereal, saying that they are the cereal people eat when they are tired of having the same for breakfast. Cindy has released herself from the handcuffs. Jennifer is completely dead, and Renson sees her when he calls for the lift. He goes up to the control room. Cindy hides under the desk so as not to be seen. Renson goes down to the set again to kill Larry Roberts. Masters is there as well. Renson shoots Larry, but fails, and Masters kills him.

"In a darkened bedroom somewhere in suburban southern California, a cloaked figure confidentially works her way through some arcane ritual; an easy assumption judging by the décor and ephemera that definitely leans toward the 'eye of newt' and 'toe of frog' - not to mention the attentive black cat and the pentagram with the goat's head at the center hanging prominently on the wall that she beseeches to. At the center of this spell are a plea to Hecate (an ancient moon goddess and the patron saint of magic, witchcraft and necromancy) and a photo of a man that she chants over and then places in a metal bowl, which then bursts into flame.
Meanwhile, the man in question falls victim to a horrible car accident and dies when his vehicle suddenly explodes for no explicable reason. Well, save one reason. As the cloaked figure pulls the hood back to reveal a young teenager with smug, self-serving smile smeared all over her face.
Cut to the next morning, at the local high school, where we find out the girl in question is a senior named Vivian Sotherland (Anderson) and the person who died was her science teacher, Mr. Hildebrandt, who was apparently on his way to meet with the school's principal for cryptic reasons concerning Vivian when his car exploded. But Vivian easily charms and sways the principal when asked why, swearing she had no idea what the problem could've been and offers to take up a collection for the poor teacher's family.
But we know this is all for show and a load of crap,and as the morning progresses, we get all kinds of hints that this isn't the first preternatural incident that Vivian 'wouldn't know anything about', including a bus crash that knocked out half the cheerleading squad, suddenly promoting Vivian to team captain, convincing them to adopt a goat as a mascot as well. (And not just any goat but an EVIL goat.) And believe me; you don't wanna know how she got to be class president. And then there's her estranged boyfriend, David Sterling (Cassidy), recently readmitted to school through more of Vivian's machinations after a drunk driving incident, where he parked his boss' van inside a sporting goods store. Seems David had some suspicions about his girlfriend, what with the football team's starting quarterback having a massive coronary, moving him to number one on the depth chart. (No second-stringers for our girl, Viv. No sir.) That, on top of all the weird and creepy crap she carries around, and the vague threats to Mr. Hildebrant, who was ready to flunk the floundering David, getting him kicked off the team, again, causing David to try and warn his teacher about her, which, alas, was all for naught and kinda backfired on him.
Thus,David's downward spiral accelerates, in spite of Vivian's dire warnings to get his act together. And while everyone else thinks the spaced-out (and now tight-lipped) David is on drugs, he has no idea who to turn to next. But luckily for him there's a new girl in school, who gladly lends a sympathetic ear. Turns out Robin Prentiss (McDonough) is blessed (or cursed) with her own empathetic ability to read people just by touching them, and after a friendly handshake she knows David is harboring a terrible secret. But as these two get acquainted, Vivian has been spying on them the whole time and is bound and determined to nip this relationship in the bud.
Once more turning on the charm, she tries to recruit Robin for the spirit squad (which already includes Vanna White and future Friday the 13th alum, Dana Kimmel), casting a spell that injures a girl to make an open spot, netting herself a snip of Robin's hair in the process, that I'm sure will be used for some nefarious purpose later. But this incidental contact gives Robin a terrifying read on Vivian as death incarnate. Then, David intervenes and pulls Robin away, warning her to stay away from Vivian. And once they're safely away, after a little more coaxing, David finally reveals the true scope of Vivian's supernatural and sociopathic reign of terror. But, as it turns out, Robin has been harboring some sinister secrets of her own.
For you see, Robin's abilities go far beyond her internal mood-ring-o-meter, manifesting themselves telekinetically as well, which gives her a natural defense against some of Vivian's more blatant attacks. (Unfortunately, one of these spells ricocheted off her and struck her father with another one of those mystery coronaries.) These powers had started to haphazardly manifest themselves back in Connecticut. Among other things she accurately predicted a friend would go into a diabetic coma and was blamed by some people for it,which prompted her father to move them way out west to put some distance between his daughter and the suspicions of others when these abilities sparked off, often dangerously, with no rational explanation except his daughter was a freak. In fact, at first, while Vivian keeps hexing her, trying to cause bodily harm, as things start flying around her house, Robin thinks it's just her own out-of-control powers going haywire again.but,when her father gets knocked out of commission, Robin finally sees that the threat of Vivian is dangerously real and she must be stopped. Having read up on witches in an effort to derail his now ex-girlfriend, David knows a witch when he sees one and does his best to help Robin hone these abilities but soon realizes they need professional help,and so, they turn to Emily Moore (Ross), another self-proclaimed witch, who learns that Robin was the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter, which is a pretty big deal in witchcraft; but her mother died giving birth to her, leaving Robin with no one to help her get control of these natural abilities,and after a decade of her father's browbeating of ignoring it and maybe it will just go away, the best advice Emily can give is to convince Robin to stop resisting her power and embrace it or she will have no chance against Vivian. To do this, Robin and David head to the park where she stretches her her powers a bit, moving things with her mind, and the romantic spark that had been flickering between them bursts into flame - just like the bush Robin mentally sets on fire and then puts out before threatening to levitate David and chasing him and falling into an embrace.
Meantime, we also get a glimpse of Vivian's busted home life, where we find out she is also a seven of seven.Her father, Sherman, (Jump), a loading dock worker and struggling inventor, is blissfully unaware of what his daughter is cooking up in her bedroom, thinking it a science experiment, but he, too, has unwittingly benefited from her power when a sole rival for a big promotion met with an untimely accident, which will net Vivian a new car once the higher salary kicks in. He accuses his wife of being jealous of her own daughter because she's the only one of their seven children that hasn't turned out a loser and is going to make something of herself. The other six have gotten into various troubles like dropping out of school and marrying losers, and seldom visit.Her mother, meanwhile, is actually fully aware of what her daughter has been up to.A witch herself, Diane (Damon) is constantly chastised by Vivian for squandering her power by abandoning it and settling for living in ""a dump"",and the lumpy potato ""simple Simon""parked in front of the TV in the other room. When her mother says her father is a good man who loves her with all his heart she replies ""His choice not mine"" Wanting it all, and willing to do anything to get it, Vivian ignores her mother's warnings about the price of such things,and judging by her expression, she knows of what she speaks,and when Diane threatens to stop her, her calcified skills prove no match for Vivian and she is easily and thoroughly defeated when Vivian psychically breaks the water glass in her hand,cutting her.Diane cleans the blood and glass off her hands as Vivian smiles and walks away.
Thus free of any repercussions, Vivian's supernatural assault on Robin continues unabated, including a nocturnal visit from her familiar, which quietly pads its four-legged way into her house and knocks an oil lamp over. (Was the cat doing this by command or is it just an asshole who likes to knock crap over.) Luckily, David took it upon himself to keep a vigil, spots the flames, and manages to get Robin out before the fire and smoke consume her. Then a flock of compelled crows attack the couple inside the van nearly causing another horrendous crash. They knock one crow out on the street and it transforms into a screaming Vivian.
When all of her efforts fail, and realizing she's about to lose David for good, Vivian confronts her arch-nemesis at the school and drags Robin off to the deserted shop classroom to deliver an ultimatum, giving her two days to clear out or the consequences will be lethal. Undaunted, Robin tells Vivian to go screw herself, triggering a nifty psychic brawl of flying lumber and power tools. And while Robin valiantly holds her own, this match ends in a draw when the shop teacher blunders in just as the sawdust settles,and once Vivian sends him packing with some conjured evidence of statutory rape in the parking lot, she reminds Robin that she has two days to leave or she won't be alive on the third.
Knowing she is well-outclassed and needing an edge, Robin and David set out to raid Vivian's house when she and her family are out, looking for some hair and personal items they can use with Emily's help to divine a spell against her, they managed to escape Vivian's cat,but this backfires when Emily discerns that Vivian is a rare Hectite, a disciple of Hecate, whose powers increase during the full moon, destined to rise the next night. Encouraged to get out of town until the moon cycle is over, Robin refuses to abandon her father, recently released from the hospital. Told in no uncertain terms to meet with Vivian, Robin and David hole up at her house, determined to wait out Vivian's threat - until the phone rings. It's Vivian, who threatens to kill her father and David if Robin reveals who the caller is and to meet with her in secret at the high school, alone, or else.
Thus, with the full moon hanging fat in the sky, Robin sneaks out of the house and enters the football stadium as instructed. From out of the shadows she hears the approach of cloven hooves, which turns out to be Vivian's pet mascot, whose impact sends her tumbling down the stairs. Knocked for a loop, Robin tries to get her bearings, but Emily's talismans and charms prove worthless, and with a wave of her hand Vivian renders Robin unconscious. And when she comes to, Robin finds herself stuck to the mooring pole in the middle of the wood-pile gathered for the upcoming homecoming bonfire. The irony of this is not lost as Vivian gloats over her classic choice to dispose of her rival. And with another wave of her hand, the fire ignites. And as the flames lick ever closer to our heroine, she appears to be doomed until help arrives from a most unexpected source.
Vivien tells Robin she should thank her for her kindness considering what the punishment for witchcraft could be and has been throughout the ages, but she prefers the classic, the burning. ""Burn witch burn!""
But Diane suddenly shows up having followed her daughter and pleased with her to stop. Vivian screams that she can't stop her and start to psychically cut her wrists. Diane shouts to Robin that they must combine their powers, and they do. Robin is able to free herself with Diane's help.Vivian angrily hurls flaming debris after her. Diane start screaming ""My fault!"" over and over again, and runs at Vivian and grabs her and throws herself and Vivian into the fire.
David runs up and consoles the horrified Robin as Vivian and her mother are burned to a crisp in the flaming pyre. David swears he will help her and be with her as she struggles to understand and control her own powers, and gets her out of there before the fire department arrives."

Her lover at the time, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lawyer Greg Savitt, was able to go through a brokerage to adopt a baby girl, who would be Christina, the first of Joan's four adoptive children. Joan believes that her own difficult upbringing has made her a stronger person, and decides that, while providing the comforts that a successful Hollywood actress can afford, she will not coddle Christina or her other children, she treating Christina more as a competitor than a daughter. Joan's treatment of Christina is often passive-aggressive, fueled both by the highs and lows of her career, the narcissism that goes along with being an actress, and alcohol abuse especially during the low times. However, Joan sees much of her actions toward Christina as Christina purposefully provoking her. Despite the physical and emotional abuse Joan hurls at Christina over the course of their relationship, Christina, who often wonders why Joan adopted her seeing as to the abuse, seemingly still wants her mother's love right until the very bitter end."

", who he has not seen in years. Andre left the profession to travel to the far corners of the world. Wally has heard from mutual friends that Andre has ""gone crazy"" from his experiences. During dinner at an upscale French restaurant, the two old friends largely talk about Andre's experiences, which often entailed applying what he knew of improvisation from the theater but applying it to real life, whether or not it be with people associated with the theater in some respect. Emerging from Andre's description of those experiences to Wally, the two enter into a philosophical discussion about life on such directly related topics as: if people in western society are living as if in a trance; if one can truly proverbially survive on such mundane and habitual items as chicken and electric blankets, and if not if one can find experiences to get out of the ""chicken"" diet anywhere if one is only willing to look; if those experiences are meant for that one person or if they are just coincidental to the person; if one should at every moment be striving to do something to be considered purposeful; and if labels are solely a mechanism to have some grounding."

But rather than be a womanizer at this stage of his life, although he has had his fair share of female companions, he feels what he is missing to be truly fulfilled is a biological son. Not wanting a wife, he decides to achieve his goal by getting one of his former girlfriends to be a surrogate to carry a child, who he would raise without her. Not as easy to find that surrogate among the women he knows, he ultimately finds a willing woman in Maggie, a waitress at a restaurant he frequents. A struggling musician - a trumpet player - who needs the money to attend a prestigious music academy in Paris, Maggie also agrees in wanting to feel that part of being a woman without the responsibility of being a mother. As Buddy and Maggie go through the process of trying to become biological parents under this legal, financial and unemotional arrangement, they may come to other realizations of what they want in life which may or may not be compatible with each other and this immediate goal of the child."

"In 1943, as the Italian Captain, Curzio Malaparte, shakes hands with the U.S. Army General, Mark Clark, the war is practically over for battle-scarred Naples. However, the long-awaited peace is yet to come. Among the devastating war's many casualties, once more, the innocents are the biggest victims, as the impoverished mothers and daughters are forced into prostitution, having no other means of survival. Against the backdrop of the mighty Mount Vesuvius, three disparate women--the virginal, Maria Concetta; Capri's aristocratic princess, Consuelo Caracciolo, and the idealistic U.S. Air Force pilot, Deborah Wyatt--find themselves trapped in an unbearable hell on earth. Is our delicate skin the only barrier between the immortal soul and the evils of the world?"
"As the opening credits roll, the audience hears ""The Clouds Will Soon Roll By"", a typical Great Depression-era type lyric, while the audience watches a rain storm. The time and place is set as 1934 Chicago.
As the action begins, an alarm clock wakes Arthur Parker (Steve Martin), who rolls over to wake his wife, Joan (Jessica Harper), by trying to interest in some early morning sex, but his shy, practically frigid wife turns him down. Arthur is frustrated by his wife's disinterest in sex. While he dresses for work, he lip-syncs ""I'll Never Have to Dream Again"" to a female voice (Connee Boswell). The song continues during breakfast with Arthur singing for himself. In addition to Arthur's sexual disappointments, he is further frustrated because his wife will not finance the start of his own business.
Arthur leaves home that morning and threatens never to return. He goes to a bank to borrow enough money to start a sheet music store. With no collateral, the banker (Jay Garner) refuses to loan him any money. During moments when his dreams are shattered, Arthur shuts out reality by escaping into Busby Berkeley-like musical production numbers. In this particular instance, Arthur and the banker lip-synch the lyrics to ""Yes, Yes! (My Baby Said Yes)"", performed by Sam Browne and the Carlyle Cousins. They are joined by several chorus girls who tap dance and toss large cardboard coins. During the song Arthur is showered with bags of coins and the song develops into a huge production number complete with over-heard camera shots of dancers in kaleidoscopic patterns and the dancers reflected in a highly polished, mirror-like floor. During one sequence, the banker and Arthur are dressed in cut-away suits and dance with a chorus line of girls.
The scene changes to Arthur driving down the road where he picks up a hitch hiker, the Accordion Man (Vernal Bagneris).
Later, while Arthur sells some sheet music to the owner of Barrett's Music Shop, Eileen (Bernadette Peters) enters. Even though she is a shy, rather plain school teacher, Arthur expresses his instant attraction to her by singing ""Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?""(performed by Bing Crosby). During the number, Eileen is converted into a lovelier version of herself and performs a tap dance routine. She leaves the store without paying much attention to Arthur.
As she walks down the street, Eileen hears the Accordion Man singing ""Rock of Ages"" and gives him a contribution, which prompts him to launch into a spirited rendition of ""The Old Rugged Cross"".
Soon, the hitch hiker devours some food at Jimmy's Diner, an Italian-American food joint. He and Arthur are sitting together in a booth, but Arthur isn't eating. As he gives his meal to the enigmatic bum, the diner walls disappear and Arthur walks out into the rain and dances to a violin solo of ""Pennies from Heaven"" (the violin soloist is uncredited; the song is sung by Arthur Tracy, who was called The Street Singer). The rain drops become coins raining down as he dances in front of a huge backdrop collage depicting various scenes from the Great Depression.
After the song, Arthur gives the Accordion Man a quarter, leaves the diner and heads for Eileen's farm. He had learned she was a school teacher, so he asked some children where she lived. Although Eileen is frightened at first, she listens as he expresses his infatuation with her.
The scene changes to a bar where a couple of other salesmen are lamenting the depression economics, but Arthur, smiling, claims he's doing great (referring more to his progress with Eileen than his sales). He and the other salesmen perform a vaudeville act-type rendition of ""It's the Girl"" (performed by the Boswell Sisters with the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra) which includes a tap dance routine and Arthur performing a short banjo solo.
The following scene shows Eileen reading the Brothers Grimm fairy tale ""Rapunzel"" to her school class. Suddenly, the children are dressed in all white and their desks become small white grand pianos on which they accompany their teacher as she sings ""Love Is Good For Anything That Ails You"" (performed by Phyllis Robins with Nicholas Orlando's Orchestra). The children also tap dance on top of their pianos. Back to reality, the school's principal scolds them for making so much noise.
Arthur is waiting outside when school is dismissed, to drive Eileen home. During their visit, Arthur makes the mistake of saying, ""My wife"", but he quickly tries to cover up by claiming his wife was killed in a motorcycle accident. Then, he plays on Eileen's sympathy by asking her to take the pain away.
When he returns home to his wife, Joan gives into one of Arthur's sexual fetishes by putting lipstick on her nipples. Once he entices her to reveal them to him, she cries and asks ""Are they as nice as hers?"" He lies to her and claims that even though he has been tempted when he is out on the road, he has refrained.
We hear the radio play ""Let's Put Out the Lights (and Go to Sleep)"" while Arthur talks about wanting to play the sax and have his own dance band.
The next morning, Arthur is happy he's had sex with his wife and she has finally agreed to finance his record shop. While he dresses, Joan sings ""It's a Sin to Tell a Lie"" (performed by Rudy Vallee and His Connecticut Yankees). During the song, she picks up a pair of scissors to stab him in the back, but it is only an illusion -she is actually still in bed. It is what she would like to do if she had the nerve.
After some time passes, Eileen is fired from her teaching position because she is pregnant. Meanwhile, Arthur has opened his record store but is languishing with few customers. One evening he drives to a bridge where he sees a girl walking towards him. He speaks to her and determines that she is blind. He offers to walk with her (with an implied sexual context) and compliments her beauty.
Later, he goes to Eileen, who informs him she is going to have his baby. She forces him to write down his address so that she'll know where to find him. He promises to do what he can to help. One of the things that attracts him most about Eileen is that she isn't shocked by his sexual suggestions; rather, she seems to relish them. In this instance, he tells her about a man giving an elevator operator $20 to turn his back so he and his date can have sex. When she likes the idea, Arthur is thrilled. She sings ""I Want to Be Bad"" (performed by Helen Kane, the Boop-Boop-a-Doop girl) as they act out their sexual fantasy in an elevator. In the following scene, the blind girl Arthur had met earlier stumbles over the bum Arthur had picked up earlier in the film. Although the film audience doesn't see the act, the bum rapes and kills the girl.
Later, as Arthur returns from his tryst with Eileen, he happens upon the crime scene and sees the blind girl dead. We see a Camel cigarette package that will later be used as evidence against Arthur. During this sequence, we hear a reprise of ""The Clouds Will Soon Roll By"" playing in the background. As Arthur leaves the crime scene, he almost runs over the vagrant who committed the crime."

With only 10 minutes to get out of the wreck before the bomb explodes, Anne and Tyler are trapped in one of the sunken ships rooms by the murderous piranha who all return to the wreck. On the surface, Steve, piloting a police helicopter, ditches the chopper and swims to Anne and Tyler's motorboat where Chris and Allison are. With minutes left to spare before the bomb explodes, Steve powers up the boat and takes off. Down in the wreck, Tyler sacrifices himself to allow Anne to escape out of a porthole and to tie a survival rope around her waste allowing herself to be pulled away by the motorboat on the surface. At the last second, Anne gets clear and the bomb detonates, destroying the sunken ship and the piranha with it. With all the murderous fish dead, Anne swims to the surface and is picked up by Steve and the two kids in their boat."

"Despite Rosie's last-ditch attempt to ensure Dave's demise by having a bouquet of red roses left in the execution chamber, Dave finally manages to escape prison and jumps into the sea, where he promptly swims to the Barracuda. Once he finds Dunlop aboard, alive but frozen stiff, he uses a borrowed piece of bubblegum to create a balloon, and both men rise out of the ocean and float back to the city. Having heard of Dave's escape, Torpedo and Rosie prepare to flee with Evelyn as their hostage. Dave manages to intercept them by jumping onto their amphibian aircraft and redirecting it to an airfield where the police are waiting. Finally convinced of the validity of Dave's powers, Dunlop over-confidently jumps off the balloon while Dave races to save him with Rosie's red feather boa wrapped around his legs. At the last instant, he manages to catch Dunlop (though in the process they wind up plunging through the earth and straight up to China), and both return safe and sound to prepare for Dave's and Evelyn's wedding. However, Evelyn, still reluctant to have a super-powered husband, has decided to have the last word in the matter by having her hair dyed red."

Upon his return home, he learns from her that she wants a divorce.

"At last, the cellar reveals its secrets opening up in full view to reveal a charnel house of mutilated bodies, its shadowy recesses dotted with surgical equipment and a gore-streaked pathology slab. The horribly deformed Dr. Freudstein is shown as a rotting living corpse with shrunken in eyes, and rotting flesh. As the couple ventures into the cellar to rescue their son, Norman breathlessly fills Lucy in on the details of his find. The 150-year-old Freudstein has apparently discovered a way of keeping himself alive by using the hacked up body parts of his victims to regenerate his blood cells. Norman attempts to attack Freudstein, but the revolting-looking ghoul twists the axe from Norman's grip. Norman then grabs a knife off the surgical tray and rams it into Freudstein's gut releasing a sickening stew of maggots and corrupted blood. Although wounded, the monstrous Freudstein continues to attack. Lucy and Bob watch in horror as Freudstein picks up Norman and literally ripps his throat out with his one rotting hand. Lucy and Bob spot a metal ladder in the corner of the basement which leads up to the cracked tombstone in the living room floor. With the ghastly monster standing between them and the cellar door, their only hope is to climb up the metal ladder and try to push apart the two stone segments to escape. Lucy strains desperately to shift the stone, but her ankle is grabbed by the perusing Dr. Freudstein. As Bob clings to the topmost rung, he sees his mother pulled down, her head battered by each metal step down.

"), enter a dank and oppressively vast cave, where a competitor of his, Forrestal, disappeared. Inside the cave are several traps rigged by the ancient people who hid a small, valuable statue there -- one of the traps is found to have impaled Forrestal. Jones finds the antechamber where the statue sits atop a pedestal and is protected by an elaborate system of pressure-sensitive stones that release deadly darts from the surrounding walls. Jones avoids the booby-trapped stones and makes it to the idol. He very deftly replaces the idol with a bag of sand, judging the weight of the treasure by sight. However, the weight is not precise, the pedestal sinks and the chamber begins to collapse. Jones runs, narrowly avoiding the darts. When he arrives at a bottomless pit he & Sapito had crossed earlier using Jones' bullwhip, Sapito crosses safely but refuses to give Jones his whip unless he gives him the idol.

"- who largely dismiss Louise as a lightweight, just the latest of Jack's girlfriends, and/or solely, in the minds of many of the men, a sexual being to be exploited. Despite their relationship/marriage largely at its end, Jack is able to convince Louise to travel to Russia with him in 1917 to report on and be involved with the Bolshevik Revolution, which Jack feels could be the impetus for the end of the war, and if successful, a model for the American working class. It ends up being a game changer in their lives, for Jack seeing the success of the working class, and for Louise being caught up in the fervor of true idealism coming to fruition regardless of the specific issue. The Revolution will have an impact on their lives in a different way as a possible cause of them never seeing each other again, as (1) it causes Russia to be an isolated nation, (2) the scourge of Communism, Jack who is largely seen as the face of it in the US, being something that most in the mainstream of American life would like to see eradicated, and (3) Communism in Russia not being true to the academic definition of the term and perhaps not quite what Jack or his socialist associates in the US had envisioned. Through it all, an issue in the background but one that plays an integral part of their story is Jack's poor health, something that he does little to improve or care for in his goal of forwarding his leftist ideals. Interspersed with the dramatization of Jack and Louise's life are current day interviews with real life players who knew Jack and/or Louise, or who knew of the issues with which they were dealing."
"Twenty-two years in the turbulent best friendship of Brit Liz Hamilton and southern belle Merry Noel Blake is presented. This phase of their story begins in 1959 as roommates at east coast Smith College when Merry, with Liz's blessing and help, ""escapes"" before graduation to elope with Doug Blake and move with him to southern California to start their married life. This move begins the divergence between the two friends with Merry living an outwardly happy life as wealthy housewife with celebrity friends, and Liz becoming a critically acclaimed serious novelist with a feminist bent. But their friendship is continually tested as each strives for a little or a lot of what the other has, sometimes in competition for who lives that life more successfully. Merry also wants to be a writer, she inherently more commercial (i.e. less serious) in her writing than Liz, but still wanting the acclaim of being serious in her craft. While she strives for this writing career, she doesn't realize that her home life is falling apart, not only with Doug but also their daughter Debby.

"Hatch goes to see Waldron and the Escape Committee to discuss a plan he's concocted.

These guards, instead, will come into the shower building, bum a smoke or two and make small talk with the POWs, which alleviates their boredom from their patrol chores. Hatch is sure that if someone went missing from the prisoners that were showering, the guards wouldn't report it, because they'd think they'd miscounted and leave the matter be until roll call.

Searching for answers, Rigby encounters assorted low-lifes: dangerous men and women who were the hallmarks of the classic detective movies of the 40's and 50's.

"Sidney Bruhl (Caine) is a playwright who is most famous for his mystery thriller ""The Murder Game."" Following the debut of the latest of a series of flops, he returns to his home in East Hampton and to his wife Myra (Cannon). He tells her that he's received a play called ""Deathtrap"" from a former student from a playwriting seminar. The play is ready for production and Sidney jokingly suggests that he murder the student and steal the play, a joke that becomes more serious when he learns, after calling the student, that no one else has read the play and no one else has a copy. Sidney invites the student up to Long Island.
The student, Clifford Anderson (Reeve), arrives shortly thereafter. Myra, who has a heart condition, becomes more and more agitated as the evening progresses, trying desperately to convince Sidney to work with Clifford on ""Deathtrap"" and share the revenue. Instead, Sidney attacks Clifford, strangling him with a chain. He forces Myra to help him drag Clifford into the yard to bury him.
Following the burial, the Bruhls get a visit from psychic Helga ten Dorp (Worth), who's staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga wanders around the living room and study, sensing pain and death in various spots and associated with various prop weapons and handcuffs Sidney has displayed on the wall. She warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him. As she prepares for bed, Myra continues to be horrified, only slowly coming to see something of glamour in Sidney's act. Suddenly, Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log. Myra flees and Clifford chases after her until her heart gives out; she collapses and dies. Sidney calmly descends the stairs, uninjured, and sidles unperturbed to Clifford's side. The men exchange a few words before their feelings emerge. They kiss, deeply and passionately. Their plan is a success: Myra is out of the way.
Immediately after Myra's funeral, Clifford moves in as Sidney's ""secretary."" Clifford works on a play which he says is about a welfare office but Sidney is suffering from writer's block. Sidney's lawyer Porter (Jones) comes over to settle some of Myra's affairs and notices Clifford is acting oddly about his manuscript pages. Sidney sends Clifford off on a pretext errand and breaks into his desk to read the manuscript. He is horrified to discover that Clifford is writing the true story of Myra's murder as a play called ""Deathtrap."" When confronted, Clifford offers to share the work and the credit. Sidney demurs: he wants to be remembered as the man who wrote ""The Murder Game,"" not as ""the faggot who knocked off his wife."" When Clifford insists he'll write the play without him, Sidney reluctantly capitulates.
A few days later, Helga stops by again, ostensibly to borrow some candles in case the power goes out in a storm that's blowing in. She meets Clifford and, when Sidney returns from a dinner party a few minutes later, warns him that Clifford is the man in boots. Sidney assures her that he'll be sending Clifford away, and Helga leaves.
Sidney asks Clifford to help him act out some possible bits of business for the play, first by resisting a frontal assault, then by demonstrating how he might wield an axe. Finally, Sidney produces a gun he's secreted for this moment, trains it on Clifford and tearfully explains to him that he cannot allow completion of ""Deathtrap"" and can only stop him with a bullet. Sidney bids Clifford good-bye and pulls the trigger.
The gun doesn't go off, though, because Clifford has taken the bullets to load a different gun that he has at the ready. Now in control again, Clifford grabs wrist and leg manacles from the prop wall and has Sidney chain himself to a chair. Clifford tells him that he's going to leave soon but, just before, will unlock one of Sidney's cuffs to allow time for his escape. Clifford will complete ""Deathtrap"" and, if anyone asks, deny that it's inspired by Sidney's story. After Clifford exits to pack, Sidney slips out of the trick cuffs (once the property of Harry Houdini) and grabs a crossbow off the weapon wall. He stalks Clifford and fells him with a single shot.
There's a body to dispose of now, but the storm hits with full force, knocking out the power. Before Sidney can find a match to light a candle, a fleeting figure scurries through the living room in a flash of lightning. It's Helga, fully aware that she's in mortal danger. Sidney finds a knife, Helga grabs a gun. Clifford regains consciousness and trips Helga. The gun goes flying and a struggle for it ensues that...
...cuts to the same struggle played live by actors before a full house, where ""Clifford"" stabs ""Sidney"" and both die, leaving ""Helga"" victorious. The opening night audience erupts in thunderous applause, and at the back of the house stands Helga ten Dorp, now the author of a hit Broadway play called ""Deathtrap."""

In the last week of 1959, Baltimore Colts fanatic Eddie is scheduled to marry Elyse on New Year's Eve, but might call it off if she doesn't pass his Colts quiz on the 29th.

Starting over the issue of Mr Talmann's wardrobe, Mr Talmann and Mr Neville snipe at one another continuously. Mr and Mrs Talmann have a bitter confrontation. It's hard to tell what the exaggerated costumes are meant to contribute: comically tall headpieces for the women, and for the men, very long, curly wigs -- waist-length, in some cases -- which, along with full-skirted coats, make them look like Edwardian schoolgirls."

"Married Paul and Mary Bland, a wine store clerk and hospital nurse/nutritionist respectively, lead an atypical Hollywood life, as they are as straight-laced as a couple could be, especially about sex as witnessed by them sleeping in separate twin beds. Foodies, their dream is to open a gourmet restaurant, although they have no money to do so except for Paul's expensive collection of wines, which he wants to save as calling cards for the restaurant's wine cellar. After failing to get the money for the restaurant by legitimate means, they decide to lure men to their apartment in the guise of a sex fantasy business and kill them to be able to steal their money, the idea stemming from Paul having recently killed a man who tried to rape Mary, the man who was attending a swingers' party in an apartment down the hall from theirs and who had a large wad of cash in his pockets. In bumping off these men, they would not only get the needed money for the restaurant but also rid the world of who they consider sexual perverts. They get an unexpected third in their larceny in the form of Raoul Mendoza, an unscrupulous locksmith and fraudster of all trades who finds out about the murders but doesn't want any of the cash on hand, only the cadavers which he will sell to an unspecified buyer, the money from which he will split equally with them. After a further discovery two have about their partnership, one of them feels that a partnership of two would be better for all, the third who he/she wants to eliminate permanently, that third not necessarily being Raoul. What happens is partly affected by Paul and Mary discovering what exactly Raoul does with the cadavers, and how else he has been profiting from the business without telling them."

"is presented, that account focusing on the rise and fall of her acting career in the 1930s and early 1940s. Growing up in Seattle the only offspring of milquetoast lawyer and his wife Ernest and Lillian Farmer, Frances became, much like her mother, outspoken and strong willed, often speaking out against strongly held societal beliefs of the day (i.e. the Christian right) concerning religion and politics, and publicly calling out hypocrisy. Her want to escape provincial Seattle life and to become an actress were equally strong, which led to a meteoric rise to a studio contract and featured roles in Hollywood movies. She quickly came to the realization that Hollywood and she were a mismatch in the studio's control of her life and her career, including of her personal life, and they largely treating her as just another pretty Hollywood starlet rather than a thinking person with strong views.

"When Mohandas Gandhi first set foot in British India, he had already been to Britain and South Africa, and had created quite a stir for the betterment of the people. But in India, he realized that he had first to live the life of a peasant to understand what it is to be an Indian. This resolve will lead him to shed his westerners clothing, don a simple loincloth, mobilize awareness of local industry, lessen dependence on imported clothing and material, the historic Dandee march for withdrawal of the salt tax, a fast unto death to stop the virtual slaughter of British troops, and be imprisoned several times. His resolve was to work with stalwarts such as Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Sardar Valabhbhai Patel, Professor Gokhale, J.B. Kripalani, Maulana Azad, and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to ensure first of all to get the British to quit India, and then run an Indian Government under the Congress party. Gandhi will soon realize that it is not enough to be just an Indian, for India has many facets - Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish, and Christian. The British relied on these many facets as an excuse for their continuance as they wanted to ensure that the minorities are not oppressed. Concerned over the inroads made by Gandhi to unite the Hindus, Muslims, and all others under a common umbrella, the British invited Jinnah for talks, and it is here that a seed was laid for a separate country called Pakistan. When Gandhi came to know about this, he pleaded with Jinnah to unite the Muslims, even take over as the first Prime Minister with his choice of Muslim candidates for Parliament, but separatist Jinnah had already made up his mind. The World Wars of 1914 and 1944 having taken its toll on Europe, and on Britain in particular, the weary British finally decided to leave India in 1947 - not the India they had conquered - but an India that was ready to be divided in East Pakistan and West Pakistan. Now after the much awaited independence was the real test for Gandhi - a test that will make him or break him - as he started a fast unto death to try and stop the violence that was threatening to break out into a civil war."

"It's the turn of the nineteenth into twentieth centuries. Andrew, a Wall Street investment advisor whose true passion is inventing novelty items, and his staid wife Adrian are spending the summer, like they do most summers, at what has long been Andrew's cottage in the woods of New York. They have hit a rough spot in their marriage, not having had sex in six months as Adrian has had a mental block concerning the act. They have invited two couples to stay with them at the cottage one weekend. Maxwell, Andrew's best friend, is a Lothario of a physician, he often sleeping with his female patients. Who he has decided to bring for the weekend is his new and very young nurse, Dulcy. On the surface, Dulcy is an innocent, but one does not need to scratch very deep below the surface to find that she is a sexual aggressive. She knows what she is doing in this department largely due to her knowledge of anatomy. The other couple is Adrian's much older cousin Leopold, a philosophy professor and general man of the world, and his younger fiancée Ariel, who Andrew and Adrian have yet to meet... or so they say. What Andrew is afraid to tell Adrian, especially in light of their sexual issues, is that Ariel is an old girlfriend of his who he once brought to the cottage, something that quickly does come to light. Leopold and Ariel will be getting married at the end of the weekend before they head off on their honeymoon. Each person at the cottage ends up having his/her hidden or not so hidden agenda for the weekend. Maxwell has for the first time in his life fallen in love - at first sight no less - to Ariel, who will at least hear him out on the issue. Maxwell cannot bear to see Ariel marry Leopold, who he considers a pompous ass. Leopold, who was a confirmed bachelor before he met Ariel, wants to sow one last wild oat with Dulcy before he settles down, something to which Dulcy is amenable. Adrian, who wants her marriage to Andrew to work, secretly wants sex advice from who is probably the most knowledgeable in that department, namely Dulcy. And Andrew and Ariel, who never consummated their relationship when they dated, can't help but wonder if they would have ended up together if they had, especially as they still have undeniable feelings for each other. The problem each couple faces is that there are four other people in their confinement who may catch wind of what's going on. But what has been known to be the enchantment of the local woods may sort out all these issues by the end of the weekend."
"September, 1973. Liberal minded young American couple Charles and Beth Horman - he a writer and translator - live in Santiago, Chile, they who chose Chile because of the comfort they felt in a country matching their own values. Charlie's father back in New York, Ed Horman, a conservative devout Christian Scientist, sees his son, and thus by association Beth, as flaky, directionless and irresponsible. Charlie and Beth's American friend Terry Simon, in the country solely for a visit, and Charlie are caught in Viña del Mar the day the right wing military overthrows the elected left wing government in a coup. At the hotel where Charlie and Terry end up for the night, they encounter US military and government officials. Because of the coup, Charlie and Terry decide to take notes of what they see, including that of the ""unofficial"" American presence in Viña. The day after the start of the coup, Charlie is taking Terry to the airport so that she can get out of the country, when they, learning that the airport is closed, are advised by American freelance reporter Kate Newman to take refuge at a large, American friendly hotel with lots of public visibility because of word that the military is taking away anyone for any reason, many of those who will end up missing never to be seen again, largely nationals but sometimes foreigners. Charlie leaves Terry at a hotel so that he can go home to retrieve Beth. Beth, however, is caught stranded away from home after curfew, and when she is able to get home the following morning, she learns from a neighbor that the soldiers had been to their house, with eyewitnesses later telling Beth that they saw Charlie being taken away. Two weeks later, Ed makes his way to Santiago to help Beth locate Charlie, Ed who had contacted his local politicians for diplomatic assistance in the matter. In Santiago, Charlie's case is largely handled by US Consul Phil Putnam, and US Naval officer Captain Ray Tower. Ed and Beth are often at odds with each other despite their common goal of finding what happened to Charlie: Ed wants Putnam, Tower and any other US official to use whatever clout they may have to assist him, Beth and Charlie - US citizens - while Beth doesn't trust them, especially Tower, for good reason. In the process of the Hormans' investigation, Ed may get a clearer picture of his son, who he would admit he really did not know. As Ed and Beth increasingly seem to be getting the runaround by those who are purportedly trying to help them, they may, with the assistance of others, get closer and closer to the truth, which may turn the world of patriotic Ed on its head forever."

""Silly Olympics"" - In a filmed section, athletes compete in absurd sporting events of the ""Silly Olympiad,"" an event traditionally held every 3.7 years. The events include
The 100m for Runners with No Sense of Direction. On the starting gun, the runners run off in every single direction.
The 1,500m for the Deaf. They don't move because they can't hear the starting gun.
The 200m Freestyle for Non-Swimmers. At the starting whistle, they all jump into the water and immediately sink without surfacing, to which the commentator remarks that they'll return to the swimming when they start ""fishing the corpses out"".
The Marathon for Incontinents (people with extremely weak bladders). In this, runners fall away from the group every couple of meters to relieve themselves, giving others the lead. This also shows them all running into the men's room on the starting gun and running past a water table without any of them getting a drink.
The 3000m Steeplechase for People Who Think They're Chickens. In this, the runners are all doing chicken movements all over the course, and seem to be trying desperately to lay eggs on the hurdles.
The High Jump briefly features, with one of the Pythons, perhaps Cleese, dressed as a woman. He takes a run-up, then jumps ridiculously high over a wall and onto a high balcony.
The ""Silly Olympics"" sketch is from the first Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus episode, dubbed into English. The original version also featured the events ""1500m for people and their mothers"" and ""Hammer throw to America"", whereas the latter acted as a link to the next sketch."

"Benjy Stone reminisces about one week in his life back in 1954 - his favorite year - when television, especially live comedy shows, were just coming into their own as popular entertainment. He was then a junior writer on one such show, ""Comedy Cavalcade"", starring the demanding and egotistical Stan 'King' Kaiser. On this week, the guest star was Benjy's swashbuckling movie idol, Alan Swann, who was past his prime as a movie star. Swann had a reputation as a boozer and a carouser, which made King and the production staff nervous about him honoring his commitment to the show. As Swann's biggest booster among the staff, Benjy was assigned to be Swann's chaperon, making sure Swann not only met his commitments, but also behaved in a family friendly manner in public. Benjy's work monitoring Swann was not an easy one, but the two became a guide for the other in navigating through issues in their respective lives. For Benjy, these included how to deal with his overbearing Jewish mother, and how to win the heart of the show's production assistant, K.C. Downing, who only saw in Benjy a manic goof-ball. For Swann, these included how to act responsibly, especially with regard to a twelve year old daughter, Tess, who he had not seen in years. Swann's unpredictability, in part in combination with issues regarding the show's on-going 'Boss Hijack' sketch, which was based on real life mobster Karl Rojeck, led to an interesting end to the week for both Benjy and Swann."

His fear of life is the primary reason he took a job as a morgue attendant rather than stay in his previous high stress job on Wall Street, despite having a natural aptitude in finance and business. He is dismayed to learn that he has been reassigned to the night shift at the morgue, if only because it will take away time available to spend with his straight-laced but neurotic fiancée, Charlotte Koogle. He is even more dismayed when he meets his new night shift colleague, William Blazejowski - who calls himself Billy Blaze - a manic, non-stop talking man, who is always trying to come up with get rich quick schemes, which are mostly hair-brained ideas. After Chuck befriends his neighbor, a good-natured hooker named Belinda Keaton, he learns that Belinda's former pimp was murdered, leaving her and many of her hooker friends pimp-less and thus unprotected by the unpredictability of their johns. From this knowledge, Billy sprouts the latest germ of a scheme: that he and Chuck, in their unsupervised state, should act as pimps - or what Billy calls love brokers - for Belinda and her friends during their night shift at the morgue. Chuck eventually agrees, if only because of his affection for Belinda, but he expands on that idea into a full-fledged pseudo-legitimate business for all their collective benefit. The questions become if this business is sustainable in light of the fact of everything about it being against Chuck's general nature, and if he will be able to balance his growing feelings for Belinda against having a personal relationship with a hooker."

"A sailor learns to take, and give, it like a man in this surrealistic adaptation of writer and thief Jean Genet's novel Querelle de Brest by avant-garde German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder. In a colorful brothel in the port of Brest, proprietor Nono is known for wagering with his customers. Win a throw of the dice, and they get to make love with his wife, Lysiane ; lose, and they must take it from behind by Nono himself. One day, Lysiane reads the tarot for her lover, Robert , and learns in the cards of his intense passion for his brother, Querelle. Querelle himself soon arrives, and the brothers enact a bizarre greeting halfway between a hug and a wrestling match. Querelle, it seems, is looking for partners in a drug deal; Robert points him in the right direction. An argument about the merits of sex between men soon leads Querelle to murder his fellow smuggler, Vic. Back at the whorehouse, Querelle loses on purpose to Nono and finds he has a taste for passive gay sex. Meanwhile, fellow sailor Gil, who looks exactly like Querelle's brother (and is played by the same actor), murders one of his compatriots after the brute publicly impugns his manhood. Wanted by the police for both his own crime and Querelle's, Gil goes on the lam.

Gunther Kaufmann, who plays Nono, was Fassbinder's ex-lover; the film is dedicated to another former lover, El Hedi Ben Salem, the news of whose suicide had just reached the director.

Moreau had previously starred in Mademoiselle, a Tony Richardson effort co-scripted by Genet. Look for Frank Ripploh, another pioneering German director, in a cameo."

In reality, she wants to be famous, but does not really want to do anything to achieve that fame. She is a hanger-on, a parasite... latching herself to anyone she thinks can help her. Her sole modus operandi is self-promotion, as opposed to doing anything even remotely related to music in her own right. The person who she tries to latch herself onto the most is Eric, a musician who has some renown from playing in the local nightclubs.

"Frank Galvin was once a promising Boston lawyer with a bright future ahead. An incident early in his career in which he was trying to do the right thing led to him being fired from the prestigious law firm with which he was working, almost being disbarred, and his wife leaving him. Continually drowning his sorrows in booze, he is now an ambulance-chasing lawyer, preying on the weak and vulnerable, and bending the truth whenever necessary to make what few dollars he has, as he has only had a few cases in the last few years, losing the last four. His only friend in the profession is his now retired ex-partner, Mickey Morrissey, who gets Frank a case, his fee solely a percentage of what his clients are awarded. The case should net Frank tens of thousands of dollars by settling out of court, that money which would at least get him back on his feet. It is a negligence suit brought on behalf of Deborah Ann Kaye by her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Kevin Doneghy, against St. Catherine Labouré Hospital, operated by the Archdiocese of Boston, and Drs. Towler and Marks. Kaye was admitted to the hospital for what should have been a routine delivery, but something that happened while Kaye was on the operating room table led to her brain being deprived of oxygen, resulting in permanent brain damage, and Kaye now being in a totally vegetative state requiring hospitalization for the rest of her life. Frank eventually learns that the cause seems to be that Dr. Towler, the anesthesiologist and an expert in the field, used the incorrect anesthetic for the situation. However, all but one person that was in the operating room that day has provided depositions that nothing improper occurred in the operating room. The one holdout is the operating room head nurse, Maureen Rooney, who is not talking, period, to Frank or the other side. Upon seeing the state Kaye is in, Frank unilaterally decides to do what he believes is the right thing by declining the lucrative out-of-court settlement offered by the Archdiocese and take the case to court. In doing so, he hopes the truth that the hospital and the doctors truly were negligent comes to light. Feeling that this case may be a turning point in his life, Frank has a new spring in his step, enough that he attracts the attention of Laura Fischer, the two who begin a relationship. Despite having whatever the truth is on his side, that truth which he does not know, and having an expert witness of his own, Frank has an uphill battle in that the Archdiocese has retained the services of Ed Concannon, a high-priced lawyer who has a large team of associates whose task is to help Concannon and the Archdiocese win at any cost. Concannon's task seems even easier as Judge Hoyle, the presiding judge, is already biased against Frank for taking the case to court."

"On a cold winter day in Moscow, two dead John Does and one dead Jane Doe are found under the snow and ice in Gorky Park, they virtually unidentifiable because whoever killed them had surgically removed their faces and fingertips. Chief Investigator Arkady Renko of the Soviet militsiya leads the murder investigation, despite he more than willing to forgo it as for various reasons he believes the murders reek of KGB involvement, especially that of a Major Pribluda, with who he has had less than official violent run-ins before. If KGB is involved, Arkady believes his life too could be in danger if he uncovers the specifics. Beyond the extreme measures Arkady goes to identify the three, he gets his first connection to a live person in the form of Irina Asanova, a young woman who works as a seamstress on a movie crew and who seems to abhor the lot in which the Soviet life has left her. Her ice skates, which she reported missing, were found on the Jane Doe. He also finds it more than coincidental when he later encounters Irina at a fancy social gathering at the home of Iamskoy, the lead counsel for the case, he who wants Arkady on the job as the best person to uncover what's going on, especially if the KGB is involved. Iamskoy does not believe the KGB should be above the law. At the party, Irina is on the arms of an older wealthy American businessman named Jack Osborne, a furrier who is often in the Soviet Union as the only place where sable pelts can be obtained globally.

The closer Arkady gets to the truth, the more his life is indeed in danger as he has nowhere to hide within the Soviet system, and no means of escape, which it seems so many people involved are trying to do."

The room is ominously labeled ""Test Room A"". The room is made up to look like an ordinary living room. At Cochran's order, one of the guards pushes the buttons to make a video play on the TV in the test room, where Little Buddy is trying to watch TV. It is the video that will be played later that night - the ""big giveaway"" video. It opens like any other Silver Shamrock commercial, but as the announcer exhorts his audience to watch, the video gives way to a jack-o-lantern flashing on the screen. After a few seconds, the rapt Little Buddy grasps his head and collapses. Multitudes of bugs and snakes crawl out of the mask. Betty faints; Buddy Sr. freaks out and tries to escape from the locked room, but he is attacked and killed by the snakes. The flashing jack-o-lantern and sounds from the commercial trigger the particle of rock in the microchip - now we see how the death of Marge was an accident, it had gone off when it wasn't supposed to. After a couple of minutes, the entire Kupfer family is dead, and Cochran cuts the video and has the guards lead Dan away."

"née Roque came by her love of driving fast cars naturally, after her father placed her behind the steering wheel as he was driving when she was a child, and as she and her then boyfriend Jack Muldowney (who would become her husband) participated in local street races when she was a teenager. As her mechanic and initial race car builder, Jack somewhat supported his wife's quest to drive in National Hot Rod races, although he saw her drag racing more as a hobby (her full time job being as wife and mother) while she saw it as her potential career. In the mid 1960's, Shirley, the type of woman who would not take no for an answer, fought through the stereotype that anyone involved in any type of motor sport had to be man, to get licensed in the National Hot Rod Association, with the help of fellow driver Connie Kalitta, who had more than a professional interest in her. Because of her female chutzpah, Connie gave her the moniker ""Cha-Cha"" (which she disliked), which would be widely used by the public and the media. As Shirley progressed in the sport, her relationships with both Jack and Connie would be tested, both personally and professionally."

"The film is loosely based on the classical Indian folktale of the hare and the tortoise, providing a modern interpretation of the same.

"Koyaanisqatsi is a visual concert of images set to the haunting music of Phillip Glass. While there is no plot in the traditional sense, there is a definite scenario. The film opens on ancient native American cave drawings, while the soundtrack chants ""Koyaanisqatsi"" which is a Hopi Indian term for ""life out of balance"". The film uses extensive time lapse photography (which speeds images up) and slow motion photography to make comparisons between different types of physical motion. In one of the first examples, we see cloud formations moving (sped up) inter-cut with a montage of ocean waves (slowed down) and in such a way we are able to see the similarities of movement between these natural forces. This technique of comparison exists throughout the film, and through it we learn more about the world around us. The film progresses from purely natural environments to nature as affected by man, and finally to man's own man-made environment, devoid of nature yet still following the patterns of natural flow as depicted in the beginning of the film, yet in chaos and disarray. Through this the film conveys its key message, which is Koyaanisqatsi: life out of balance; crazy life; life in turmoil; life disintegrating; a state of life that calls for another way of living."

A group of six bikers is heading to Daytona to watch the races, they having made plans to convene at a prearranged stop along Hwy. 17 so that they can ride down together.

Within the military, this attitude applies largely to flight, where there is a continual race not only to fly faster and higher, but do it first and especially before the Soviets. The men that are going to achieve these feats are the ones with the ""right stuff"". One of those initial targets is to break the sound barrier - Mach 1 - with pilots in the newly commissioned US Air Force at Edwards Air Force Base in California primarily those attempting the feat, many who will die in the process. But with what is happening in the Soviet Union will accelerate the American space program, which will largely usurp the political and public consciousness on those aeronautic feats.

Regardless, many pilots apply for the seven positions within the first American space program - Mercury - the seven chosen who do whatever they can to make flying expertise an important aspect of the job. In all these situations, the support from the women behind the men is demonstrated, they who have the continual fact of one in four not making it back from a flight in the front of their minds.

Plus, in case Frank comes up short a few million, Tony will earn the money needed through his own street contacts.

Tony replies that it's time for them to ""think big,"" and to expand the cartel for nationwide distribution of cocaine. With them as the main North American distributors and wholesalers of the Sosa cartel, they will make millions and become the biggest cartel in the continent.

"""There's a moral imperative here."" Silkwood (1983) by Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen is an historical drama about a 28-year-old plutonium processing worker, ""Karen Silkwood"" (Meryl Streep), who aligns with the Union to secretly gather evidence of Kerr-McGee plant's safety violations. The hope is to gain leverage for upcoming contract negotiations, which Karen thinks is a good thing for her co-workers, but many of them fear for their jobs as well as for Karen's own safety, more than they fear being proverbial ""canaries in the coal mine."" The threat of cancer from plutonium exposure seems less important than losing their income. Nonetheless, Karen pushes ahead, despite being warned that what she's doing is dangerous. The danger becomes real when Karen realizes she's been intentionally contaminated-and then accused of contaminating herself--which is ridiculous considering the torturous shower and scrub she must endure every time she sets off the radiation alarm. Things come to a head when her entire home is stripped of its contents-due to plutonium contamination-and she gets tested to confirm her ""internal"" contamination. No doubt, this would have been a good place for Karen's activism to stop, but Karen attends yet another union meeting-after which an attendee recalls seeing her leave with documents. While on the way to meet with a New York Times journalist and union official, Karen is killed in a front-end crash into a ditch. The car appeared to be run-off the road, but, because sedatives were found in her system, it was deemed an accident. The epilogue of the film states that no documents were ever found in Karen's car, but that the Oklahoma plant closed down a year later, leaving the audience with the mistaken impression that Kerr-McGee went out of business, which did not happen. A significant detail, which the film doesn't cover, is the fact that the rear of Karen's vehicle had unexplained damage, suggesting that it was pushed."

"This movie is based on texts of Bohumil Hrabal, world-known Czech prosaic. It's a story (in a form of a mosaic of short episodes and pictures) about the sadness and happiness of inhabitants of Kersko (Kersko is a small woody area full of cottages and roods). These people are both simple and sensitive, they have their own pleasures (e.g. Leli is a collector of cheap, but inutile things) and the greatest delight of all of them is a hunting. Crude poetics of amateur hunting is screened by dreamy pictures of this area. Menzel mixes sentimental lyricism and rough (but not vulgar!) humor and the outcome is the never-ending landscape of continuous life in the proximate nearness of nature. The performances of actors are brilliant. Both Rudolf Hrusinsky as a Franz and Jaromír Hanzlik as a Leli have nonrecurring charm bottomed on a pain and inebriation. Only the music is not perfect: Jiri Sust usually assembled his film music from his older works and in this movie there is many quotations."

Just after cashing in on the $250,000, Buford finds Cledus and begins to apprehend him, but Buford then imagines Cledus to be the ""Real"" Bandit (in a cameo appearance by Burt Reynolds) who sweet talks him to letting him go and starting a new pursuit.

"Approximately ten years in what is the complex relationship between long widowed Houston-based upper middle class Aurora Greenway and her adult daughter Emma Horton is presented. There is general love and affection between the two, which is nonetheless characterized by Aurora's overbearing and judgmental nature and Emma's need for acceptance from her mother regardless. Aurora's focus on being a constant influence on Emma's life was strengthened upon the death of Aurora's husband/Emma's father Rudyard when Emma was an adolescent. Despite allowing a few ardent but rather undistinguished admirers into her life, Aurora did not actively pursue romance following being widowed, again turning that energy largely to Emma. This phase of Aurora and Emma's story starts when Emma marries Flap Horton, of who Aurora openly disapproves as a man she considers ambitionless (as he wants to be an academic). Aurora and Emma's relationship hits some further challenges when Emma, Flap and their children at whatever given time make moves away from Houston for Flap's career advancement. Although Aurora and Emma talk frequently on the phone due to the distance, Emma, a stay at home mom, is largely left to deal with the issues in her and Flap's less than perfect marriage on her own. Meanwhile, with extra time without Emma nearby and the hands of time slowly passing, Aurora eventually decides to take a chance and ultimately accept a date with her longtime next door neighbor Garrett Breedlove, an aging astronaut to who she never really even talked over the years due to their outward differences. While Garrett is miles away from the gentility that Aurora seems to admire in others and in herself, Aurora is conversely unlike most of the women Garrett pursues, he using his celebrity status to chase after nubile young women half his age."

"Philadelphia based Louis Winthorpe III was born into and has solely lived a life of privilege. He is Harvard educated, is successful at his job, has a lavish home paid for by his employers, and is wealthy. The children he will probably have with his fiancée Penelope will most likely also know nothing but privilege. But he and his friends, who all have similar backgrounds, are pompous and snobbish. His job is as managing director at Duke & Duke, a commodities brokerage house owned by brothers Randolph and Mortimer Duke. The Duke brothers often disagree with each other and make wagers on the outcome of these disagreements. Their latest wager is about ""nature versus nurture"": the importance environment plays versus one's natural bloodline in determining how one's life will turn out. The guinea pigs in their experiment are Winthorpe, whose life they will attempt to ruin to see how he reacts, and Billy Ray Valentine, a black hustler/crook who the Dukes and Winthorpe encountered in one of his scams. Like Winthorpe, Valentine was born into and has lived the only life he has ever known. They will attempt to place Valentine into every aspect of Winthorpe's life to see how he functions. Without either knowing of anyone else involved, Coleman, Winthorpe's manservant who is officially employed by the Dukes in his day-to-day job, and a streetwise hooker named Ophelia each play a role in the Duke's plan. Also deeply involved in their plan is a private detective the Dukes often use, Clarence Beeks. Beyond the outcome of the Dukes' experiment, can either Winthorpe or Valentine change the course of the new life set out for them by the Dukes, even if they knew what the Dukes were doing? Regardless, this experience will fundamentally change the lives of both Winthorpe and Valentine, but not at without the expense of others as well."

Meanwhile, David Lightman, an intelligent but academically unmotivated Seattle based high school student, is a computer whiz.

When her father dies, Yentl is all alone in the world.

Anshel then finds ""him""-self in the awkward position of being called into service as substitute bridegroom, so that the wedding can go ahead and Haddas will have a husband. It is a marriage that never gets consummated - apart from the more obvious reasons, because Haddas still wants Avigdor (though she eventually falls in love with Yentl, too).

"Mockumentary on the period of fame and infamy of Leonard Zelig in the 1920s and 1930s. He first came to world attention when it was noticed that he appeared in several newsreels more often than not prominently in the background, but sometimes with the newsreels' more famous subjects. But what was considered more remarkable than the varied subjects and the prolific nature of his newsreel footage was that he changed his appearance, sometimes even seemingly his ethnicity, and abilities and skills to match those around him. Eventually under the care of famed psychiatrist Dr. Eudora Fletcher, he was given the nickname the Chameleon Man in his ability to change his being so effortlessly. Dr. Fletcher's diagnosis was Zelig's need for ultimate conformity in an effort to be universally liked, the malady which she tried to cure. The mockumentary delves not only into the psychiatric issues for Zelig, but also the legal issues he faced on wanting and being able to conform so easily. It also focuses on Zelig and Dr. Fletcher's relationship, which became more than just patient and doctor."

"is being interviewed by American journalist Julia Schofield about how his life ended up on the path it did, unusual considering his proper British upbringing. In relaying his story, he focuses on the transition into his senior year at a prestigious boys school in Britain in the 1930s. He was friends with Tommy Judd, largely because of them both lying somewhat outside the lives of the other students. Judd was an intellectual Marxist, who would not participate in what he considered the oppression of school traditions which were perpetuated by fathers - former students - sending their sons to their alma mater. Guy, who did aspire to the top rung of the student hierarchy by becoming a ""God"" - one of the top prefects - in his senior year as a stepping stone to becoming a diplomat as a career, was open about his homosexuality to his classmates. That year, he believed he fell in love for the first time in his life with fellow student James Harcourt, those feelings reciprocated. Both Guy and Tommy were friendly enough with their fellow house upperclassmen, who respected Tommy for having principles to which he did not stray, and turned a blind eye to Guy's sexual activities if only to maintain overall peace. An event at the school that year involving another student would place greater scrutiny on the activities and behaviors of the entire student body. Tommy would be asked to do something that both appealed to his Marxist ideals of working for the greater good, but that also went against his principles against the traditions of the school. A struggle for power, with all students, including Guy and Tommy, largely against a tyrannical student named Fowler, who likened himself to a military officer, would have a profound affect on Guy and his life beliefs."

Al tells him that Birdy spoke, this being the first time that Al has used the nickname ""Birdy"" in front of Weiss. Weiss doesn't believe it as Birdy looks the same, not uttering a word. When Weiss tries to get Al to leave, Al grabs him and pushes him against the wall. After Al lets go of him, Weiss runs out of the room. Al asks Birdy why he didn't say anything to Weiss, Birdy's response being that he had nothing to say to him. Two orderlies rush in trying to subdue Al. He manages to beat up both. Al grabs Birdy as the two run out of the room. With the orderlies on their tail, Al and Birdy head up the stairs toward the roof. As Al barricades the door of the roof behind them, Birdy runs toward the edge of the roof. Birdy raises his arms and jumps off the side of the roof like he is about ready to fly. Al yells for Birdy to stop. Al, stopping the barricading, runs over to the edge from where Birdy jumped. He looks down, expecting to see Birdy dead on the ground below. Instead, Birdy is on another level of the roof, only a few feet down, perfectly fine. Birdy looks up at Al and asks quizzically of Al, ""What?"""

Jake also finds out by catching her in the act that his girlfriend Carol is cheating on him, he not even suspecting before that that there was a problem in their relationship. After moving out of Carol's apartment and crashing on his friend's couch for a few days, Jake, in what may be a turn in his fortunes, is offered a house-sitting gig by Sam Bouchard, a fellow actor he recently met. Sam had been sitting at this friend's luxury house in the Hollywood hills, but asks Jake to sit for him during an out-of-town run on a play in which he has been cast. Beyond the luxury of the house itself, it is an easy gig in that Jake can do whatever he wants at the house, his only task to water the plants to make sure they don't die. On top of the ease of the gig, Sam also informs Jake of a bonus in that a beautiful neighbor with long brunette hair across the valley, the interior of whose equally luxurious house can be seen through a telescope, performs a sensuous striptease every night at the same time. During the sit, Jake becomes obsessed with the brunette, first in a romantic sense because of the striptease, then later in a protective sense as he can see that there are some issues in her life. Those issues include a male in her life physically beating her, and a native American seemingly stalking her probably to rob her. Because of this specific voyeur activity, Jake is implicated in a murder investigation. A chance sighting of porn star Holly Body may give Jake some clues as to what happened in the murder, which is only further complicated by his claustrophobia."

"During the mid 80's Alan Rudolph became one of the most interesting ensemble cast filmmakers since Robert Altman.
His quirky boutique dramas had style and flair and a touch of the 80's hip angst. This is my favorite of that time. The art direction and camera movements are as much story tellers as the dialogue. Pay attention to the paintings and posters in the scenes. They almost always have a subtext comment to the exact scene being spoken by the actors. And Rudolph loves to let his actors act! There is a brilliant scene where Mickey (Keith Carradine) is eating breakfast with Nancy/Ann (Geneviève Bujold). The camera pulls back, zooms in and pans like a tennis match as the actors go thru an unbroken 3 plus minute dialog scene. I haven't seen a scene go that long since the opening of Rope! This film is full of great dialog, style and fun!"

"Twenty-six year old Alex Gardner has psychic abilities. He was once in a psychic abilities scientific study under the leadership of Dr. Paul Novotny, but left the study seven years ago without a word or a trace, no longer wanting to live continually hooked up to electrical probes. Alex has since lived off his big winnings at the race track, his uncanny ability to pick the winners consistently which has come to the attention of some low life criminal elements who want a piece of his action. Dr. Novotny does locate Alex for the two to discuss his latest scientific breakthrough: dream therapy. Through electronic connections, he has discovered a way for psychics to be able to enter into the dreams, or as the case may be, nightmares of others, in order to treat the patients through or in dealing with the dreams/nightmares. The reasons for Alex agreeing to participate as one of the psychics are threefold: to get away from that criminal element at the track, they who are after him; a little moral suasion on Dr. Novotny's part; and Alex's attraction to Dr. Novotny's associate, Jane DeVries. The study is clandestinely supported by the government, the liaison for the government being Bob Blair, a personal friend to the President. As Alex begins to see the benefit to others in the work, he also begins to suspect that others involved in the study, namely a fellow psychic named Tommy Ray Glatman, and Blair himself, are working on their own agenda against the goals of the study. That alternate agenda may have something to do with the fact that the President himself has of late been suffering from recurring nightmares - something only his inner circle knows - which is now dictating his political agenda. If Alex comes close to discovering the truth of that agenda, his life, the lives of others in the study, and that of investigative writer Charlie Prince, who Alex befriends, may be in jeopardy."

"Needing to reenter the workforce following the separation from her husband, Alice Yarrow moves with her two daughters - fourteen year old Cathy Yarrow and adolescent Laura Yarrow - from big city Toronto to small town Parry Sound where she has a job teaching elementary school. Of the three, Cathy may have the biggest adjustment in the move because of her age. Although Cathy quickly makes a friend in Evelyn, a girl who can only think about Toronto life, Cathy will need more stimulation in Parry Sound than just hanging out with Evelyn. She decides to continue doing something she's done the past several winters in Toronto, namely play organized ice hockey as a goalie. As there is no girls' league in town, she decides to try out for the town's minor bantam boys team, the Parry Sound All-Stars, there no official regulation stating that she can't. To her excitement, she makes the team, passing muster with both her teammates, who can't help but provide a little ribbing in the process, and the coach, Willy Leipert. The star of the team is Spear Kozak, who comes from a naturally talented hockey family. While Spear's older brother Bradley had the talent perhaps to make it to the NHL, he didn't have the temperament or the maturity. As such, Spear and Bradley's father places a lot of pressure on Spear to take up the slack - Spear accepting that pressure - Mr. Kozak expecting Spear to make it into the NHL by the time he's seventeen. Because she's a girl, Cathy has more scrutiny placed on her to do better than the boys to even have a chance. Added to the mix is Spear and Cathy's burgeoning friendship, one that is not only as teammates but also as a teenaged boy and teenaged girl. The team's longtime sponsor, Bill Moss, may have some say into what happens, his bottom line being the almighty dollar and what he sees as the negative repercussions of having a girl on the team on his stereotypical male-oriented business, ""Mr. Lumber"". As the All-Stars approach the ever important tournament against the team from North Bay, Spear, the only player who has the necessary clout, will have to decide if he will fight for Cathy to stay on the team or go with Mr. Moss' flow, especially as some scouts will be attending the tournament specifically to see him."
"In a typical college in a typical Indian city, the hostel boys Madan Sharma (Aamir Khan) and his friend are a rowdy lot. The teaching staff suffer from the common apathy of most teachers in similar colleges. The administration has the usual problems, with ill-paid employees periodically going on strike. On the whole, the college is a very normal place. But on this particular day, when Madan and his friends rise from their slumber, some with the customary hangover, they are not so perturbed to find no water in the taps again, as when they hear that it is not going to be a holiday after all. Instead there will be a lecture in the auditorium by the Chairman of the Board (Dr. Shriram Lagoo), on the day of the festival of fire, Holi, and the boys decide not to attend the classes. The hostel superintendent Professor Singh (Naseeruddin Shah), the only lecturer with some human links with the students, watches with apprehension their growing restlessness. A notice announcing a further postponement of examinations adds to the bitterness. A fight erupts out of nowhere between principal Phande's (Om Puri) nephew and another student, in which the principal's nephew is hurt and the other boy is promptly rusticated. It is an unjustifiably drastic punishment, and the news spreads like wildfire. Resistance is organized in the library, in the laboratory, in the classrooms and the college grounds. In the auditorium, the first egg hits the Chairman, and pandemonium follows. To save his own job, the principal decides to track down the culprits. Professor Singh politely refuses to help. The principal now blackmails one of the hostel boys, whose father he knows, and who is in any case a loner, and a butt of jokes in the campus. Imbued with a false sense of power, the boy walks into the principal's trap. A large group of boys, all from the hostel, are immediately rusticated, and asked to vacate their rooms by the morning. The boys, not all of them actually guilty of rebellion, are now all in a rage. They make a bonfire of the hostel furniture and their textbooks. Feeling impelled to share his sense of triumph, the informer confides in the boy whom he hates and fears the most, and whose name he has kept out of the list. As a result he is mercilessly humiliated by everyone, and just about manages to rush away from his tormentors and lock himself in his room. In the gathering dusk, the young rebels sit listlessly on the steps of the hostel, their anger giving way to depression, when one of them discovers the informer hanging from the fan in his room, quite dead. Madan and his friends confront faceless policemen who come to investigate the suicide. In the morning, the police van carrying the boys away, is caught in the midst of a rowdy, jostling crowd of merrymakers, playing with colours.

He sneaks into the building at night time, where the lift reveals itself to have a sentient mind as it operates properly until he tries to access the shaft, at which point it crushes the chair he was using. He then goes to the top floor with the elevator machinery and finds the metal enclosure containing the microprocessor is empty. He enters the elevator shaft, climbing onto the carriage to inspect the shaft for the replacement chip by plugging into the emergency controls on the elevator roof, resulting the microprocessor sensing this and stops him. He sees a faintly pulsating box above so he climbs wires up to it, where he uncovers the cover plate and sees viscous sticky goo crawling around a silicon chip making the sound of a heartbeat. Unnerved, Felix attacks the gooey silicon chip with his screwdriver where in response, the microprocessor starts the elevator at high speed and attacks Felix with its counterweight. Felix falls but manages has to catch onto a ledge below a set of elevator doors. As the elevator car hovers above him, Felix furiously scrambles to open the doors from the floor below and tries to hoist himself out, but his hands slip on the glossy floor.

"Charlie is an American stage actress working in England. She is neither Arab or Jewish, but is openly supportive of the Palestinian side in the Middle East conflict, although her ultimate want is for Middle East peace with an end to the current bloodshed characteristic of the conflict. However, through an elaborate set-up, the Zionist factions in the conflict recruit her to work on a campaign to uncover the person behind the name ""Khalil"", a Palestinian who has been orchestrating the killings, through the delivery of crude bombs, of prominent Jews. The Zionists want someone like Charlie in the role who has a real and credible non-Jewish back story, and someone who can act in the needed undercover work. Charlie agrees if only because of her growing romantic connection to one of the recruiters, Joseph, who she originally thought was a prominent Palestinian activist named Michel who happens to be Khalil's brother. She also agrees on the understanding that she would not be directly involved in the killing of anyone. As Charlie gets further into her role, she has conflicting emotions about Joseph. She also comes to the realization that both sides will do whatever they need to to achieve their end goals."
In the second sequel of the popular TV series Laura and Almanzo are forced to go looking for Rose who was kidnapped. A young orphan looking for a home and Jason Carter's wish to give his mother a happy Christmas are also parts of the story.
"The series goes out with a literal bang in this two-hour special, featuring virtually all of the cast from the final season. As the episode opens, Charles and Caroline Ingalls celebrate his first vacation in two years from the job he took in the big city at the start of the 1982-83 season. Caroline has acquired a telephone and is able to talk to some of the Walnut Grove people (including Laura and Mr. Oleson, now president of the town council). She is also talking to Aunt Tess, a notorious chatterbox who wants to come visit them. Charles hates the idea because Tess won't stop talking and makes health food that tastes like grass. He complains about it so much that he gets into an argument with a restaurant patron and gets decked for his trouble. Caroline has an ingenious solution: why doesn't Aunt Tess come to the big city (the two youngest daughters, who aren't seen, adore her) and THEY go on a trip elsewhere? Charles warms to that idea and they decide to go see Laura, Almanzo and granddaughter Rose in Walnut Grove. While on the train, Charles accidentally steps into a luxurious parlor car rented by a land baron and his henchman. The land baron is cordial to Charles' face but dismisses him as a local yokel. Then back to the business at hand: the land baron has by various means acquired the rights to the Mesabi iron range in Minnesota. He has most of the land he wants, but there are several towns in the area. His solution is to send his hireling to the towns to scope them out, then go there himself and claim all rights to the land underneath the towns. The towns can continue, but everybody in them will now work for him. The hired man shares a stagecoach from the train station to the Wilder place and is suitably impressed by the mansion Laura and Almanzo have built, but his real purpose is to get into the Oleson hotel and make calls back and forth to his boss saying how ripe for the plucking Walnut Grove is. Charles arrives in time to greet Laura and to check in with the Carter boys (who came in as he was leaving) on their latest scheme of breeding rabbits (a major plot point, as it turns out; the Carters live in the old Little House on the Prairie and have converted the barn into a rabbit house). The land grabber waits for church to spring his surprise. Great consternation ensues as the land grabber shows he owns every square inch of dirt under Walnut Grove and will evict everyone who doesn't go to work for him). He even has a U.S. Army regiment to back him up, using the same sort of logic that was used in various Government grabs of Indian territory. The townspeople back down (although the colonel in charge is a sympathetic figure) - but Laura, who has done very little up to this point, expresses her frustration by smashing all the windows of her house so the land grabber can't get to them. This gives another town resident, who already works for the iron mines, an idea - the land grabber can have the land under Walnut Grove, but he won't have one useful stick of the city. In ritualized settings of dynamite (starting with the Wilder mansion) the entire town goes kaboom one building at a time. The Army colonel grins as he tells the land grabber the self-destruction was perfectly legal, and residents of other towns who have been invited to watch the hostile takeover prepare to fight in similar fashion. The land grabber leaves with his tail between his legs, and the townspeople go off to start new lives elsewhere. The Little House on the Prairie (the last building left) is left intact - and left to the now-free rabbits."

"Father Tim Farley, who presides over St. Francis Church, is arguably the most popular priest within the diocese led by Monsignor Thomas Burke, Father Farley's popularity as witnessed by the size and enthusiasm of the congregation at his church services. Many see Monsignor Burke as autocratic, he having a very narrow and traditionally conservative view of the church in addition. Father Farley often socializes with Monsignor Burke, the two most recently having gone on vacation together to Yugoslavia, but Father Farley sees this socializing more as a professional obligation than a true want, Father Farley who will tell what he considers little white lies to get out of many of those social commitments. Father Farley will tell those little white lies in more circumstances to achieve his desired end, those lies of which his devoted, loyal and devout housekeeper Margaret refuses to be a part. Although not having much to do with the diocese's seminary, Father Farley plea bargains with the Monsignor to ordain seminarian Mark Dolson as a deacon, the Monsignor's condition being only if he is to be the deacon at St. Francis for a one month probation period. The Monsignor's original want not to ordain Mark is because Mark often openly challenges what church elders tell him, the Monsignor feeling that Mark not having the temperament not only to be a deacon but more importantly a priest. Although Father Farley had seen Mark's challenges first hand and thus sees him as much as a pain in the neck as most of those at the seminary do, he came to Mark's defense in this matter if only in not agreeing with the Monsignor's open and closed judgment of Mark, the judgment solely because Mark often disagreed with his views. In spending time with Mark, Father Farley finds that Mark doesn't have a filter between his thoughts/emotions and what comes out of his mouth, in turn the congregation as a collective not having the best initial opinion of him. A series of events leads to a specific incident placing Mark's position in the church at risk. As such, Father Farley has to make a decision about how far he is willing to go to defend Mark at the risk of his own personal and professional standing. In the process, Father Farley may have to examine his own many imperfections as a priest and a human being."

"1901. Peter Soffel is the warden at Allegheny County Prison in Pittsburgh. He is rather an emotionless man, which affects his relationship with his wife of eighteen years, Kate Soffel, the two who have a cordial but somewhat emotionally distant marriage. They live with their four children on the prison property. Despite there being a chaplain on prison staff, Kate provides Christian spiritual guidance to the inmates. Following a three month serious health issue, Kate returns to her work including with two infamous new inmates, brothers Ed and Jack Biddle, who are sentenced to death for murder. Although the brothers are admitted robbers, there is some question within the public mindset if they did commit the murder in question. They have their legion of fans, primarily young women, who are attracted to their charisma and particularly Ed's good looks. Kate and Ed get into philosophical discussions of Christ and redemption, specifically in his and Jack's situation, which leads to them getting to know each other. Although initially done for different motives on both sides, Ed does convince Kate to help him and Jack escape from prison. Ultimately, the motive becomes love, the two who have fallen for each other. As such, Ed convinces Kate to run off with them, much against Jack's wants. What happens to the three is affected largely by that public mindset, some who want them caught at all cost, some who want solely to say they were involved in dealing with the famous Biddle brothers, and some who believe them innocent and want them to succeed. Of those old enough to understand what is happening, Kate's family members also have their own views of what she did and how it affects their individual relationships with her if she ever does return."

In the room where Tina and Rod are sleeping, Tina is awakened by noises at the window; someone is in the back yard hurling small rocks at the glass. Tina knows this is whoever has been trying to frighten her, and she goes downstairs to confront whoever it is. When she ventures out into the back yard, a phantom voice lures her into the alley, the same as in her dream. She is startled by strange things such as a goat suddenly lurching into the alley, and then finally her stalker emerges, a man in a fedora, a dirty red and green striped sweater, and the deadly glove with knives for fingers. He taunts Tina by laughing at her and whispering her name, and he walks towards her with his arms stretching further than humanly possible, spanning the entire alley, blocking her escape. Tina retreats into her back yard and the figure leaps out again, this time from behind a tree. He slices off his own fingers and strangely colored blood spurts out. Tina tries to make it into her back door, but the man grabs her, and she struggles with him. We see Tina in bed next to Rod, trashing around; she has been dreaming this incident, as well, only the man seems to actually be under the covers with her. Rod awakens and pulls off the sheet. He can only see Tina, but she is being manipulated by some unseen force. Her stomach is slashed open, four wounds appearing all at the same time, obviously from the glove. Tina is dragged screaming up the wall, over the ceiling, and falls down dead into the bed, which is now covered in her blood. Nancy and Glen have now awakened and burst into the room to find Rod gone, apparently through the window. Tina is dead."
"It's 1984 in the Territory of Oceania, formerly England. It is ruled by a totalitarian regime led by Big Brother espousing an ideology called Ingsoc. Big Brother is ever seeing through a two-way camera system, which not only broadcasts continually about the regime and its fight against enemies, especially the resistance led by Emmanuel Goldstein, but has eyes on the populace, who are referred to as brothers and sisters. When not broadcasting, a still photograph of Big Brother is on the screen representing his omnipresence. Individual freedoms are seen as the cause of all society's problems, hence Big Brother's control over what everyone says and does, which includes a move to end not only the thought and practice but also the need for love and sex. Anyone breaking the rules, in action or thought - the latter called ThoughtCrimes - are dealt with by the Thought Police. Winston Smith is a seemingly faithful low level bureaucrat for the Party, his job to rewrite history to the Party's guidelines, in the process he destroying any hard evidence of the reality of actual history. However if the Party knew, Winston would be considered a criminal as he has been keeping a diary of his individual thoughts, he writing out of sight of the cameras, and has been clandestinely purchasing banned items from a black marketeer, Charrington. Although suspect of her at first, Winston discovers another subversive working inside the bureaucracy, a young woman named Julia, the two who fall in love in their shared pro-freedom values. If they are caught by the Thought Police, they will discover the lengths Big Brother takes to control brothers and sisters, and in the process learn what is reality and what is manufactured by the Party for its own end."

"The film opens with sweeping shots of the vast, barren Texas desert as the camera follows a man wandering through this terrain. The man is shown entering a rundown bar as he collapses in exhaustion. The next day, a doctor treating the speechless traveler makes a call to a family member, who we discover is the brother of the ailing man, recommending that he pick his brother up. As Walt, the brother of the wanderer Travis, leaves for Texas from Los Angeles, before the doctor has returned to his patient, the viewer finds that Travis has taken off continuing his wandering through the empty land. Travis is finally found and picked up by Walt in South Texas as Walt tells his silent brother that they are heading back to Southern California. Though Travis is yet to speak, the viewer hears Walt explain how he has not seen nor heard from Travis in four years. Their first stop along the road is a small motel where they plan to rest for the night, but when Walt leaves to get food from the market, Travis starts the shower and takes off again. Walt returns to discover Travis is gone and quickly tracks him down not far up the road and is able to get him back into the car. The next scene shows the two in a diner, Travis still silent, and Walt begins to question Travis more forcefully about his disappearance adding that he left his son, Hunter, behind when he was three for Walt to take care of in Travis' absence. The viewer sees Travis is effected by the mention of his abandoned son as tears flow from his eyes; however, he still fails to answer Walt's inquiries. The pair continue on their road trip the following day and finally Travis begins to speak in the car. He produces a weathered photograph of a vacant lot with a ""For Sale"" sign explaining to Walt that he purchased the property and that it is located in Paris, Texas- a city mentioned to him by their mother that he believes to be the location of his conception. While Walt is curious about this idea, he claims that he is continuing on to Los Angeles to bring Travis to his son. Upon their arrival, Travis meets the wife of Walt, who has practically mothered Hunter for the last four years, and he confronts the young boy, who is uncomfortable and timid towards the stranger. Walt decides that showing some old home videos might help to break the ice of the awkward relationship between Travis and Hunter. The videos show touching moments of Travis with a newborn Hunter and his wife, Jane, sharing a day at the beach with Walt and his wife. That night, the viewer sees Travis carry out chores around the house as he is sleepless and bewildered by his presence in this house with his son. The next day, Travis shows up at Hunter's school attempting to walk home with him; yet, Hunter sees him across the street, grows weary, and jumps in a car with a friend. Hunter explains that night to Walt's wife that he does not want to walk home at all from school, and certainly not with Travis. She pleads with him to give Travis a chance as he sighs somewhat in compliance. Travis tries again the next day to walk Hunter home and he makes progress as the two silently walk on opposite sides of the street. The viewer sees that eventually Travis's persistence pays off as he and Hunter are beginning to converse more on their walks. One night, as father and son have now grown more comfortable with each other, Walt's wife tells Travis in secrecy that she knows Jane, Hunter's mother, is still around and that she in fact deposits money into a bank account for Hunter on the same day of every month. She goes on to tell Travis the name of the bank and that it is located in Houston, Texas. Travis is almost immediately determined to seek Jane out and he tells Hunter of his plan the next night, explaining why he has to leave, as Hunter tells his father that he wants to accompany him on his journey."

Britons Adela Quested (Judy Davis) and her probable future mother-in-law Mrs. Moore (Peggy Ashcroft) have just arrived in Chandrapore in British India to visit Adela's unofficial betrothed, Ronny Heaslop (Nigel Havers), who works there as the city's magistrate. Adela and Mrs. Moore, who long for ""an adventure"" in experiencing all India has to offer, are dismayed to learn upon their arrival that the ruling British do not socialize, let alone associate, with the native population. Such people as the Turtons, Mr. Turton (Richard Wilson) being Ronny's superior, who openly thumb their noses at the idea in their belief that the Indians are an inferior people. They are further dismayed to see that Ronny adheres to that custom in not wanting to jeopardize his career. At the local white only club, Adela and Mrs. Moore find a like-minded Brit in the form of Richard Fielding (James Fox), the school master at government college, he who offers to organize a small, but truly inclusive, social gathering with some natives for them, unlike the large party the Turtons organize, where the natives are treated poorly, and are used more as window dressing for Adela and Mrs. Moore's benefit. In addition to Fielding's colleague, eccentric Brahmin scholar Professor Narayan Godbole (Sir Alec Guinness), Adela, and Mrs. Moore would like to invite Aziz Ahmed (Victor Banerjee), a young, widowed local physician with whom Mrs. Moore had a chance encounter. As Mrs. Moore is the first Brit who has ever treated him with kindness as she did at that encounter, Aziz is happy to attend. As Aziz wants to impress them by being what he thinks they want him to be, which is more western, he offers to organize an outing for this small collective to the Marabar Caves, which has some renown. The outing is despite Aziz never having been to the caves himself, and despite the expense to himself, that sum of money which he really can ill afford. Something that happens at the caves has the potential to bring the British-Indian bridge that has been forged within this small collective come crumbling down, that something which also threatens Aziz and Adela's lives in the process."

The creatures have no eyes, and Charles discovers they are sensitive to sound in which their open mouths, filled with hundreds of sharp teeth, seem to be their receiver of sounds since they apparently do not have ears either. The large three-headed creature almost eats him when he snaps his fingers, and he is only able to distract it by tossing his flashlight into a far corner and allowing it to go after the noise. Adding to the horror, he sees Barb's disembodied head lying on the cement floor, partially consumed by spawn, and realizes that the creatures have killed his parents. Charles stands motionless against a basement wall, unable to move in fear of being discovered by the alien creatures."

"Stop Making Sense opens as lead singer David Byrne walks out onto an empty stage holding only an acoustic guitar and a portable cassette tape player. He introduces the first song, ""Psycho Killer"" by saying ""I want to play a tape."" As the show progresses, Byrne is accompanied by the rest of the members of the band as well as some guest performers. Tina Weymouth is the first to appear for the song Heaven. Then Chris Frantz appears for ""Thank You for Sending Me an Angel"" and Jerry Harrison for ""Found a Job"". Instruments and equipment are gradually brought out onto the bare stage during the first few songs and the entire group is brought together for the band's big hit, ""Burnin' Down the House."" The film offers us a glimpse inside the mind of lead singer David Byrne through the progression of the songs and stage effects. In a self-interview included in the film, Byrne talks about the physicality of music and that it doesn't have to make sense to the mind if it makes sense to your body. Director Jon Demme's use of wide angle shots to give the viewer a sense of being in the crowd as they are able to view the whole stage and all of the performers at once. Unlike many concert films and videos, which use more quick-cut editing techniques in an MTV-like fashion, much of Stop Making Sense uses lengthy camera shots to allow the viewer to examine the performances and onstage interaction and the limited amount of crowd shots, which only appear at the end of the film, allow the viewer to make their own judgments about the film. The film is a great look at one of the leading bands in the New Wave movement of the late 70s and 80s and is a must see for any fan of Talking Heads."

"This unflinching look at teens living on the streets of Seattle was one of the first documentaries to deal with the ever-growing plight of homelessness among young people. It began as a Life magazine article by photojournalist Mary Ellen Mark and writer Cheryl McCall; Mark and her husband, director Martin Bell, went back to Seattle to film the daily lives of the throwaways and runaways. The film is shot cinéma vérité style, with no narration to guide the viewer. Bell and Mark found a large group of subjects willing to talk about their lives of panhandling, prostitution, petty crime, and drugs. They're proud of their abilities to survive, but there's a strong undercurrent of wistfulness about their observations. There are glimpses into the family lives that drove these kids to the streets: an alcoholic mother, another woman who's mystified that her daughter won't come home now that the girl's stepfather has promised not to force sex on her, and a convict bullying his son during a jailhouse visit. The latter relationship clearly inspired Mark and Bell's next project, the feature American Heart, which also took place in Seattle. Mark published a book of her photographs under the title Streetwise in 1988."

"Jack and Kay Walsh are typical of many couples of the 1940s, where he is the breadwinner and she the housewife dependent upon him to do the man's duties around the house. Jack believes one of their neighbors in the housing complex in which they live in Los Angeles is white trash - he letting her know so at every opportunity, while Kay is quietly curious about her. That neighbor is streetwise Hazel Zanussi, an aspiring singer who does get a chance to sing on occasion at the club managed by her casual boyfriend, Biscuits Toohey, although he relegates her to being one of the taxi dancers more often against her wants, while he cheats on her behind her back despite truly having feelings for her. Hazel just wants to make an honest living. Their worlds are turned upside down on December 7, 1941 when the US enters WWII with the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. Jack immediately enlists in the Navy, and while he will send money home, his decision leaves Kay largely to fend for herself. Against what she knows are Jack's wishes, Kay decides to follow the request made by the government to the female population to do their part in the war effort by getting an assembly line job at a factory, in Kay's case as a riveter at Santa Monica-based MacBride, a military aircraft manufacturer. Hazel, too, gets a job there. Despite a rocky start based on how Hazel knows Jack feels about her, Kay and Hazel become best friends in the process, largely in their and their fellow female employees needing to stand up to the taunts by their less than enthusiastic male colleagues. Working for a living and having Hazel as a friend results in Kay standing on her own two feet for the first time, including making important decisions on her own. Kay is pursued romantically by their line leadman, Lucky Lockhart, who sees himself more as a musician, a trumpeter, than a factory worker. Kay has to decide how far to go with Lucky, to whom she is admittedly attracted, but she does not want to betray Jack, especially due to the reason for his absence. With all these issues going on in Kay's life, she will be tested to see if she can go back to her previous life in all its aspects if and when Jack makes it home, especially after the war."

Alex does not sign the papers, but walks to his classroom and begins packing, resigned to the fact that he can no longer make a difference. Lisa arrives and urges him to fight the school board, certain that they would never risk firing him over Diane's abortion because of the bad publicity it would generate. Alex becomes tearful as his students enter the classroom to support him. After Lisa makes one more desperate attempt to remind Alex about his ideals as a teacher by literally stripping off all her clothes in public, he declares to Rubell and Dr. Burke that he will not resign by quoting ""I'm a teacher!""

". Underlying the assassinations were White's social conservatism, Milk's open homosexuality (Milk being the first openly gay elected official in the United States), and Moscone's support of Milk.

"Israel circa 1,000 B.C. The adult life of David, who would eventually become King of Israel, is presented. The blessing of the Prophets, as the voice of God, is required before the King can take any major action. It is because God is annoyed with King Saul for not following his word that the Prophet Samuel, taking his cues from God, surprisingly and unexpectedly anoints David, the teenaged and youngest of Jesse's four sons, the next King. Regardless, it isn't until David's encounter with Goliath that he and many of the Israelites believe he could and should be King. Believing the anointing of David undermines his rule, King Saul, whose army is far outnumbered by those of the enemy Philistines, takes one measure after another against David and by association at the peril of his army in battles against the Philistines. These moves by Saul do not sit well with many, but especially his son Jonathan, who supports David as the next King.

"Valentin Arregui and Luis Molina are unlikely cell mates in a Latin American prison. Valentin, a journalist, is a political prisoner who was working for a leftist anti-government revolutionary group. While in prison, he is frequently tortured in order to cough up information on those with whom he is working. That includes the new prisoner in the cell across the block from his. Valentin has yet to provide the authorities with any useful information. Molina, a stereotypically gay window dresser, is imprisoned on morals charges: having homosexual sex with a minor. He states that he has no political affiliations. To pass the time, Molina recounts aloud story-lines from his favorite movies, usually those of a romantic nature. The current movie of which he is telling is a wartime romantic thriller, which in reality is a World War II Nazi propaganda film, about which he doesn't care as he focuses on the romance part of the story. Because of the reason for his imprisonment, Valentin doesn't much like that Molina is telling a story produced by a repressive regime, but gets caught up in Molina's story-telling regardless. The unlikely cell mates form an equally unlikely friendship based on their mutual support for each other. Molina later admits that he has fallen in love with Valentin. What Valentin does not know is that Molina has been co-opted by the prison warden and the secret police to befriend Valentin so that he can get information on and report back to them about the leftist group with which Valentin is working. Molina's reward is early parole. The question becomes on whose side is Molina really supporting if either."

She is currently the sole breadwinner, a diner waitress--until her daydreaming at work, specifically about the lives of movie characters--gets her fired. The latest of these movies is a lighthearted comic adventure called ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" which she has now seen several times. During one of those screenings, Tom Baxter, a secondary but pivotal character in the movie--a self-described poet, explorer, and adventurer--walks off the screen into the audience, stating that he has seen Cecilia at several screenings before, and fallen in love with her, and Tom and Cecilia take off together. This causes may problems: the other characters on the screen can't continue without Tom, studio executives are concerned about anything libelous that Tom might do for which they would be legally responsible, and they are concerned that other characters from the movie will also walk off, not only at this theater but at others where the movie is being screened. Cecilia also sees it as a problem; although she likes Tom and likes being with him, she knows that he's not real. Another person who sees it as a problem is Gil Shepherd, the up-and-coming young actor who portrays Tom; he sees Tom's move as potentially destroying his career. But as Gil gave Tom life in his portrayal, there could be some of Gil in Tom. So when Gil heads to New Jersey to try to persuade Tom to go back into the movie, Gil, a real person, could also also see in Cecilia what Tom sees in her."

American vampires met in Chicago and founded the Capa Nostra Society,
making Johnny Terrori their president. European Vampires met in Dusseldorf
to create the Vampire Group and elected Count Dracula as their leader. One
of Dracula's sons, the scientist Werner Amadeus von Dracula, began working
on an anti-sun formula. In 1905, after years of testing his formula on
vampire dogs, Werner tried it on a vampire, but it failed miserably.
Werner was laughed out of Europe, so he took his young nephew Joseph and
moved to Cuba where he perfected a new formula based on rum and pina
colada that he called ""Vampisol"". Werner fed this formula to his nephew
and found it so successful that young Joseph, now known as Pepe, grew up
in the hot Cuban sun and had no idea that he was really a vampire. It is

The triad also has an unofficial agreement with the Italian mafia, still seen as the major player in organized crime in the city, to be cooperative in a win-win situation in their illegal activities.

"Charles Bronson delivers a powerful performance in this riveting story based on actual events.
Bronson portrays Jock Yablonski, the united Mine Workers official who tried to refofm his union by challenging its ruthless, corrupt, all-powerful leader, Tony Boyle.

"The cocky Private Hudson tracks the colonists by using homing devices embedded in their skin, and discovers that the entire population seems to be crowded underneath the primary heat exchangers of the facility. The team take the APC to the atmosphere processor, where Apone and the marines get out and Gorman and Burke remain aboard with Newt and Ripley to coordinate the sweep from a distance. While descending into the facility, the marines discover strange organic, hive-like structures that must have been secreted by the Aliens. Ripley realizes that the marines are walking next to the colony's nuclear reactor, and that their armor-piercing weapons could do serious damage to it that could cause it to explode. Gorman orders them to hand in their high-caliber ammunition; however, both Vasquez and Drake secretly reactivate their smart-guns, using spare connectors Vasquez had hidden in her equipment. As the team enters the basement, they find an Alien hive containing the dead bodies of the colonists, cocooned as hosts for the Alien facehugger parasites. One colonist is still alive, but she starts to convulse upon awakening, asking them to kill her. Suddenly, an infant alien (a chestburster) bursts its way out of her chest. The marines kill it with a flamethrower, but the sudden stir awakens the dormant warrior aliens, which are concealed inside the walls which offer them effective camouflage. They begin to attack, causing one marine to misfire her flamethrower, causing an explosion of an ammunition stash. The resulting disorientation proves disastrous, as the disoriented marines have no idea where the attackers are coming from, and are quickly reduced in their numbers. The marines start firing back at random, some with the restricted ammo, but the chaos and noise make it hard for anyone (especially Lt. Gorman and Sergeant Apone) to focus and organize a coordinated defense. Apone is suddenly attacked and incapacitated, causing an unprepared Gorman to panic. Angered and frantically shouting at Gorman for his lack of control, Ripley takes control over Gorman's protests, driving the APC all the way down the service ramps into the nest to rescue the surviving marines. Only four make it back to the APC, and one, Drake, is killed by acid from an exploding Alien shot by Vasquez. Ripley recovers Vasquez, Hicks and Hudson. Hicks manages to kill an Alien that tries to enter the APC with a shotgun blast (""Eat this!""), which results in a large acid burn on Hudson's arm. Gorman is knocked unconscious while Ripley drives the APC out of the facility, crushing an Alien under the wheels along the way and driving straight through a closed metal door. The escape destroys the APC's transaxle, rendering the vehicle largely immobile."

"The film begins in the small Russian village of Shostka as the camera zooms in on the Moskowitz house. Then, the camera pans down to a tiny door marked Mousekewitz, the dwelling of a mouse family that includes Papa (voiced by Nehemiah Persoff), Mama (voiced by Erica Yohn), their son, Fievel (voiced by Phillip Glasser), their daughter, Tanya (voiced by Amy Green), and a baby, Yasha. Inside their tiny living quarters, Papa plays his violin while Mama takes care of the baby. Fievel comes running into the room asking about Hanukkah presents. Papa presents Tanya with a new babushka and gives Fievel a new hat (Papas hat that has been passed down from father to son for generations). The hat is far too big, but the boys mother tells him he will grow into it.
As part of their Hanukkah celebration, the Mousekewitz children encourage Papa to tell them the story of the Giant Mouse of Minsk, who was as tall as a tree and scared all the cats. Mama doesnt like even a mention of the word ""cats,"" and asks them to talk about something else. The children want to hear about America, which Mama thinks is just another fairy tale, but Papa appears to drift off into a dream world as he talks about the opportunity of a new and better life in America where mouse holes are everywhere, bread crumbs are on every floor, mice can say anything they want, and, he knows for a fact, there are not cats.
Just then, they are attacked. Humans and mice run from their homes as the Cossacks attack the humans and their homes, while the ""Catsacks"" attack the mice and their dwellings. Brave little Fievel tries to scare the cats away by banging loudly on a skillet with a spoon, but he is chased and almost killed by the cats. Suddenly, the pogram is over and the Cossacks and Catsacks withdraw. Afterwards, as they survey the damage, Papa whispers, ""In America, there are no cats."" The scene shifts to a Hamburg, Germany shipyard where a band plays an oom-pah tune as the mice, including the Mousekewitz family, climb a rope to board a ship bound for America. Fievel creates problems with his wide-eyed wonder and constant questions. Once they are on board, the mice shout their goodbyes to the other mice on the pier as the ship departs.	During the voyage, Papa plays his violin in the mouses small section of the ship away from the humans. Just like all children, Fievel asks, ""Are we there yet?"" Tanya is afraid theyve made a poor decision to travel to America, but Papa reassures her that everything will be all right as long as they stay together.
Later, Fievel discovers a barrel of herring and Papa tells him about even larger fish in the ocean. The mischievous boy wants to see them. When he tells his mother about the fish, she says theyre lucky they didnt see cats. The dreaded word causes all the mice to shutter. Papa reassures all his fellow mice passengers that America will be wonderful because there are no cats there. His statement leads the mice to tell horror stories of cats as they sing ""There Are No Cats in America."" After Papa sings a verse, all the mice join in the chorus; then, an Italian mouse sings about the cat problems in his country, after which the mice all joyfully sing the chorus; next an Irishman sings a verse, after which the mice celebrate and sing the chorus again.
Soon, a storm hits and the ship rocks, which causes a lot of seasickness. While Fievel is warming himself by the stove, a piece of burning coal burns his tail. When he jumps, he is washed him around the ship until he ends up at the bottom of the stairs leading to the deck. He is fascinated when a wave washes some fish down the stairs, so he climbs up to see more. Out on deck, he is overcome by the storm and the waves. Fievel imagines all sorts of sea monsters in the waves of the storm. After one particularly large wave, Fievel is washed overboard and the ship sails away into the storm.
The following scene is of Castle Gardens, the immigration depot in New York City. As both humans and mice go through immigration, they are given new American names. When the Mousekewitz family passes through they are sad that they are now a family of four not five. The immigration officials change Tanyas name to Tillie. Next, we see a small bottle flowing on the water. As a chorus sings ""Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor,"" the words written on the Statue of Liberty, the audience sees Fievel inside the bottle. As he peers through the bottle, he sees the Statue is under construction. When the bottle washes ashore, a French pigeon, Henri (voiced by Christopher Plummer), who claims to be building the statue, discovers him. After Henri cleans up the little immigrant, Fievel talks despondently about the possibility that he will never find his family. Henri, in a Maurice Chevalier-type voice, boosts the boys confidence by singing ""Never Say Never."" Fievel and three female pigeons join in the song. Afterwards, Henri instructs one of the females to fly Fievel to immigration.
The next scene is the city, which is full of immigrants humans and mice and they are all being hustled by con artists. One of the slickest of the scoundrels preying on the unsuspecting newcomers is Warren T. Rat (voiced by John Finnegan). His constant companion is his cockroach accountant, Digit (voiced by Will Ryan).
Upset that he has made fifty cents less today than yesterday, Warren T. spies the innocent Fievel, introduces himself and claims he can take the boy to his parents. Fievel follows the rat anticipating the reintroduction to his family right away.
Meanwhile, at the Mousekewitzs new home, an old, discarded physicians bag, Tanya tells her parents that she has a feeling that her brother is still alive. Just as she looks out a window, Fievel and Warren T. pass unseen nearby.
When Warren T. takes Fievel into a building and opens a door, Fievel excitedly looks inside for his family. He is grabbed by a mean character named Moe (voiced by Hal Smith). Fievel has been tricked and is now in a workhouse or sweatshop. Warren T. reminds Moe to send Fievels salary to him. That evening, Fievel ties several sheets together and escapes by climbing down the sheets to the street. Tony Toponi (voiced by Pat Musick), an Italian immigrant mouse, gives Fievel an Americanized name, Philly. Once he is out of the workhouse, Fievel unknowingly walks right past his familys home in the doctors bag. As Fievel wanders the lonely streets, we hear ""Poor Wand'ring One."" Once, the boy hears someone calling his name, but its another mother calling her son named Fievel. Later, he hears someone playing a violin and thinks its his Papa. He is very disappointed to discover the sound is coming from an Edison cylinder recording. When the lady of the house changes the cylinder, Sousas march, ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" blasts from the speaker, which causes Fievel to fall into the player. The sight of a mouse frightens the lady who chases Fievel out a window.
After some more wandering, Fievel runs into Tony Toponi again, who volunteers to help find the kids family. At the same time, Tanya and Papa leave their home to search for Fievel and at one point, Tony and Fievel walk directly above Tanya and Papa and neither sees the other.
During their search, Tony and Fievel happen to pass a rally where a pretty Irish mouse, Bridget (voiced by Cathianne Blore), is trying to convince the other mice to organize in order to defeat the cats. Tony is immediately smitten with Bridget. While Tony gets acquainted with Bridget, Fievel tells the crowd they have nothing to fear because his Papa told him there werent any cats in America. Just then, from behind a crate, a cat pounces on Fievel and almost eats him. After a frantic chase where Fievel avoids becoming the cats meal, Bridget suggests she and Tony take Fievel to see Honest John (voiced by Neil Ross), a local politician, who knows all the mice in the city. Just as soon as Tony, Bridget and Fievel leave, the Mousekewtiz family emerges from under the rubble that is left from the cat attack. Mama sarcastically asks Papa, ""there are no whats in America?"" Papa sheepishly snickers.
When the new trio of friends arrives at Honest Johns, Gussie Mausheimer (voiced by Madeline Kahn), the richest mouse in the city, is also there to complain about the cat attack. She recommends a ""wally"" (Gussie cant pronounce ""r""s) of all the mice, rich and poor, to decide a course of action against the cats. When Gussie leaves, Honest John is ready to help Fievel find his family until he discovers that the Mousekewitzs are too new in the country to be registered voters. He is only interested in helping if votes are his reward.
That night, Fievel sleeps in a water tower where Bridget lives. She encourages the boy and tells him she is certain his family is out there somewhere just waiting to be found. After Bridget leaves, Fievel gets out of bed, goes to a knothole in the wall, looks out over the city and, as the moon rises, sings ""Somewhere, Out There."" From her doctors bag home, Tanya joins Fievel in the song. They dream of reuniting their family.
At the rally in the park, Fievel is on the speakers stand with Bridget and Tony, while his family is in the audience, but once again, they dont see each other. Gussie delivers a stirring speech about coming to America for freedom freedom from cats. When she asks for ideas concerning a course of action, no one offers any suggestions until Fievel steps forward and whispers an idea into her ear. She smiles, whispers the idea to Honest John, and then announces to the crowd that they have a plan.
Early the following day, all the mice go to Dr. Digitalus Museum of the Weird and Bizarre, which is located on a pier. They collect various objects from the museum and begin to build a large contraption. Tony wakes up late, so he grabs Fievel out of his bathtub bed and they run towards the pier to help the other mice. Fievel has trouble keeping up, trips and falls into a sewer grate. When he thinks he hears his Papa playing his violin, Fievel drops down into the sewer and follows the music. He finally discovers the source of music in a place marked ""Mott Street Maulers."" The music is coming from a player piano and a violinist. Inside, a group of cats are playing poker. One of the cats is Tiger (voiced by Dom Deluise), a large orange cat, who is pretty dimwitted.
When the camera pans up to the music, the violin player is Warren T. Rat. Warren T. complains he cant play because of his nose, so he removes his false nose and ears, which reveals that he is really a cat. Fievel blurts out ""He's a cat!"" Warren orders the other cats to capture the intruder. Tiger tries to help, but is more trouble than help. A big chase ensues. Just when it seems Fievel has escaped again, a paw grabs him and pulls him back into the sewer.
Back at the museum, Gussie explains the plan to the other mice. They are going to scare the cats onto a ship that is bound for Hong Kong with the contraption they have built. Since the ship departs at 6 a.m., the mice must lure the cats to the pier at that precise time.
Fievel is being held prisoner in a birdcage in the sewer and is being guarded by Tiger. When Tiger finds out that Fievel lost his family, he empathizes because he lost his family too. We also learn that Tiger is a vegetarian cat. Once Fievel and Tiger become friends, they perform a song and dance routine together titled ""A Duo."" Digit, the cockroach, sees the prisoner and his guard frolicking together and tells his boss. Fievel manages to escape, so Warren T. fires Tiger.
Back on the street, Fievel heads to the pier with the cats right behind. Inside the museum, the mice are sleeping, but Fievels frantic screams wake them up. The cats are ten minutes early, but since the cats are there, the mice in charge of the secret weapon release it. Since it is too early, Honest John and some other mice finally stop it. In front of the museum, Tony shoots Warrens fake nose off exposing him as a cat. Then, Warren sets fire to the museum. Gussie, who is watching the clock, commands the secret weapon be released. Fievel grabs a piece of burning wood and burns the rope that is restraining the weapon. When it begins to move, it throws Fievel up against the wall and knocks him out. Out of the burning building the contraption, the Giant Mouse of Minsk (from the story Fievels Papa had told them), comes rolling down the pier and frightens the cats. They run down the pier, into the water and are lifted onto the departing vessel by the ships anchor.
During the mices celebration, Tanya hears Honest John say, ""We owe it all to Philly."" She asks Papa, ""Who is Philly?""
Leaking kerosene causes the fire to spread and the pier is consumed in flames. Bridget and Tony look for Philly but all they find is his hat. Tanya hears them calling Philly and reminds her father that immigration changed her name to Tillie. She runs towards the calls; Papa and Mama follow. When they meet Tony, Mama recognizes Fievels hat. Fievel is revived by the firemens water hoses. The force of the water washes him through a hole in the floor. He ends up in Orphans Alley where he meets a group of street urchins who convince him to give up hope of ever finding his family. They tell him if his family really cared, they would have found him by now. Fievel cries himself to sleep.
The next morning when Fievel awakes, he hears someone calling his name, but he thinks it is just a dream. Gussie, Tony, Bridget, and his family are riding on Tiger searching for him. Fievel finally pays attention when he hears Papa playing his violin. When he shouts ""Papa,"" his father hears him, jumps off of Tiger and runs towards his son for a happy reunion. The others soon join the celebration. Papa returns Fievels hat, which, to everyones amazement, fits. Papa says, ""My son! Now, you are a mouse."" The following scene shows Henri flying Fievel and Tanya to see his finished statue. Papa and Mama are flown by another pigeon and Tiger is transported by multiple pigeons. They all admire the Statue of Liberty. The statue even winks at Fievel and Tanya. Fievel asks Henri about all the other land they see from the air. He tells the boy that all of it is America. Fievel wants to see it. Henri assures him that he will someday. As Henri flies them away from the statue, Fievel and Tanya say ""Goodbye.""
The closing credits roll over drawings of the statue. Then, ""Somewhere Out There"" is heard again as performed by Linda Ronstadt and James Ingram."

Because Eric is unable to verbally communicate and his parents died when he was five in a plane crash, Eric faces the constant threat of institutionalization by unsympathetic social workers who believe he is a threat to himself and the community because Eric has an affinity for climbing onto rooftops and standing on window sills.

"Having taught at the best institutions in the country aside from other more eclectic jobs, James Leeds, with progressive methods, has just started teaching at a school for the deaf on an island off the New England coast, where he is assigned primarily to a speech class for the upper grades. At the school, he quickly notices the young cleaning woman, who he learns is twenty-five year old Sarah Norman and who, deaf herself, was once a student there and has been there since the age of five. He can see that she is bright, headstrong and angry, on top of which she doesn't speak, the latter issues a result of a troubled home life, her mother, her only touchstone to family, who she has purposefully not seen in eight years. As he is able to get through to most of his students to feel more and more comfortable in speaking for a more holistic life, Jim, with the reluctant blessing of the school's superintendent Dr. Curtis Franklin, who has always and still considers Sarah a proverbial pain in the you-know-where, tries to get Sarah to learn how to speak so that she can reach her full potential beyond being a cleaning woman, which he will further learn is a choice if only as it allows her to live her life somewhat in solitude in her silence and anger. Although unable to break through to her on the speaking side of the equation, he is able to break through on a more humanistic level as they end up falling for each other eventually embark on a relationship. The question then becomes if there is the possibility of a long term future for them, especially in being able to bridge their many divides - not only the divide between the world of the hearing and the deaf - and in Sarah never having had a sense of who she truly is as a complete human being and not just the deaf girl who may now see what Jim is doing as solely his latest ""project""."

A frumpy spinster with little experience with men, Lenny is the forgotten one. Meg, the middle sister, is the narcissistic wild child who left for Hollywood to pursue a singing career, which is not going as well as she would like those at home to think. Growing up, she generally got what she wanted as the extroverted one and arguably because she was the one who found Momma in the basement. ""Who"" she wanted was Doc Porter, who now walks with a limp due to an incident with Meg, but would probably run back to her if she returned--despite being married. Becky ""Babe"" Magrath, the youngest, married Zackery Botrelle at 18; now he's a lawyer and state senator but she is the overgrown-little-princess kind of wife.

He survived--he's in the hospital recovering from the stomach wound--and Babe doesn't deny shooting him; she claims she was actually aiming for his heart. But she refuses to tell anyone, including her young lawyer Barnett Lloyd, why she did it. The dynamic among the very different but loving sisters plays into how they deal with Babe's situation and their own issues."

In New York, Kathy is physically assaulted in her apartment late one night by an intruder.

"A group of academics at the University of Montreal--most long time friends--plan to gather at the lakeside recreational home of Rémy and Louise, who have been together for 20 years, married for 15 of them, for dinner. Louise knows Rémy cheats on her, but believes he only does so when she is not around, which she accepts. Their recreational home is adjacent to many of the recreational homes of the others, who are: divorced Pierre and his much younger current girlfriend Danielle who is a student at the university; divorced mother Diane; independent-minded Dominque; single homosexual Claude; and graduate student Alain; While the four men prepare the dinner, the four women are working out together in the gym. The common factor between the two groups is the topic of conversation: sex, especially as it relates to themselves. But underlying each of the conversations is their own academic and intellectual backgrounds, which shapes the nature of the discussions. When the two groups finally converge for dinner, a ninth person is added peripherally, brusque working-class Mario, Diane's current sexual partner. This relationship is a first for Diane in that not only their sexual encounters but the way they interact with each other in general is predicated on S and M, dictated largely by Diane, the submissive. What happens with the group as dinner goes into evening and evening goes into morning is further shaped by them listening to a prerecorded interview Dominique did for CBC Radio earlier in the day to promote her new book, which discusses how the quest for individual happiness in modern western society is leading to the decline of the society in general."

"There's a time travelling 1-eyed mad scientist that created a cyborg with a laser on his arm. Said cyborg attempts escape certain dismantlement, which ends up killing some Asian assistant scientist that tried to help him. After escaping using tank treads as legs and shooting lasers at hired goons, he goes to another scientist for help... played by Lt Yar from Star Trek. Yar has a little flying robot that seems to be a mix of that owl from Clash of the Titans, and R2-D2.
Yar, Owl2-D2, and ""Mandroid"" then hire a river ruffian to pilot a boat to go up-stream. They find traces of Mandroid's human past with a picture of his wife and child. He can't yet remember who they are just yet..
That boat eventually crashes, and they end up being captured by some Neanderthals... presumably brought to the present by the time-travelling 1-eyed mad scientist. After escaping the poorly costumed cavemen, they come across a ninja who is out for revenge since he was the son of that random dead scientist at the beginning. He can manipulate time and space with his mind (done by playing recorded video in reverse or slo-mo)... but only sometimes, and for no reason.
The River Ruffian, Lt. Yar, Mandroid, Owl2-D2, and the ninja find those old tank treads and uses them to attack the time travelling 1-eyed mad scientist's lair. Owl2-D2 and the tank treads bite the dust, and they carry on inside the compound.
The time travelling 1-eyed mad scientist then shows up now also a cyborg (but red), yet wearing gold armour he took from Ancient Rome since he wants to go back and be the Caesar of the time. Looking like Iron Man on acid, he then shoots Force Lightning (a la the Emperor of the Sith) from his Roman shield, and traps the crew in a shrinking net of electricity. Mandroid then sacrifices himself (with minimal protest from the others) to save them. He dies. (Yes.. the main character dies and never finds out who he was and what happened to his family who should be still alive since it was only a year ago he was changed into a cyborg)
The Ninja, Ruffian, and Yar then go inside and send the time travelling 1-eyed mad Roman Iron Man scientist back to 430,000,000BC, where he yells and shakes his cyborg hands to the sky in anger. They all just smile and then.. credits.
The End. Awesome."

"Ethnic Notions is Marlon Riggs' Emmy-winning documentary that takes viewers on a disturbing voyage through American history, tracing for the first time the deep-rooted stereotypes which have fueled anti-black prejudice. Through these images we can begin to understand the evolution of racial consciousness in America. Loyal Toms, carefree Sambos, faithful Mammies, grinning Coons, savage Brutes, and wide-eyed Pickaninnies roll across the screen in cartoons, feature films, popular songs, minstrel shows, advertisements, folklore, household artifacts, even children's rhymes. These dehumanizing caricatures permeated popular culture from the 1820s to the Civil Rights period and implanted themselves deep in the American psyche. Narration by Esther Rolle and commentary by respected scholars shed light on the origins and devastating consequences of this 150 yearlong parade of bigotry. Ethnic Notions situates each stereotype historically in white society's shifting needs to justify racist oppression from slavery to the present day. The insidious images exacted a devastating toll on black Americans and continue to undermine race relations."

Her family is desperate, especially her guilt-ridden older sister Margaret, who was the one who talked Maureen into taking a trip to see Europe. Despite some comforting words, the State Department has no idea where the girl is, which leaves her desperate family out of options. However, Grandpa Winston suggests that they should turn to pulp heroes like Remo Williams (a.k.a. The Destroyer), Mack Bolan (a.k.a. The Executioner) or Jake Speed (a character made-up for the movie) for help. Everyone believes it's just dementia talking until Margaret's best friend Wendy visits her the next day and finds a message addressed to Margaret under the door. The note only says that if Margaret wants to see her sister again, she should go to a sleazy bar near the peer. Driven by guilt, she does so and meets Jake Speed's assistant Desmond Floyd there. He explains that Jake is willing to take her case for free. Jake then finally shows up, but he seems like he's not all there. He explains to Margaret that her sister is being held by Sid, a sadistic murderous British white slaver and crime lord, who operates from a (fictional) African country, where a full blown armed rebellion is in progress. He also explains that all pulp fiction heroes are actually real (including Doc Savage) and that their novels are all based on their wild real-life adventures. Margaret buys this and agrees to travel there with Jake and Desmond. However, once there, she's attacked, almost blown up and almost sold into slavery by Jake, all as part of his plan which he neglected to explain to her. She eventually begins to suspect that there's something wrong with Jake and his friend and runs away. She finds her way to a consulate that's being evacuated due to heavy fighting. The consul explains that Jake and his friend are two infamous benign fraudsters, who actually believe that they are two pulp fiction heroes. However, when he asks Margaret to lead him to the barn where the two are religiously waiting for her return, it becomes perfectly clear that Jake, although not exactly at his best, is very much who he says he is, but the consul is not. Jake and Margaret are captured and taken at gunpoint to Jake's archnemesis Sid's villa, where Margaret's sister is being held as well. Can the good guys win, even in the 1980s?"

Now that she knew where Toby was, all she had to do was get to him, but that was the whole problem.

Sarah didn't know how long this had been taking her but knew she hardly had any time left. All that she knew was that if she didn't hold Toby in her arms in time, he would never be the same again; she had to save him from becoming a goblin. So with a gulp and wincing of her face at the thought of how broken her bones would be once she fell to the ground beside him, she jumped."

The arrival of an attractive new girl in his school and neighborhood proves a mixed blessing: Maggie becomes his best friend and companion, admiring his many talents, but inevitably she soon falls for Cappie the other way, so now his 'big brother' and protector seems little Lucas's rival, however hard the hunk tries to stay friends..."
"Elsewhere, majorette Vicky McAllister (Terri Godfrey) lives with her rich but invalid grandmother and her grandmother's housekeeper, Helga Schuler (Denise Huot). Unknown to Vicky, Helga and her son, who happens to be Harry (a pervert who spies on Vicky and her fellow majorette friends in the locker room showers and takes nude photos of them) poisoned her grandmother (rendering her paralyzed, mute, and utterly helpless) and murdered Vicky's parents years earlier. Helga has re-written the grandmother's will to inherit everything if Vicky and her grandmother die, but a small catch can foil the entire plot: Due to an irrevocable clause in the original will that had to be left intact in the forged revised will, if Vicky dies before her 18th birthday, the grandmother's fortune will go to the state without an adult heir left alive to inherit."

"Paul Stephens, a high school student in Ithaca, New York, is generally unmotivated academically despite being a science geek, his interest, as per his age, mostly in those science items that have a wow factor. It is his interest in science that connects him to Dr. John Mathewson, a scientist recently having relocated to Ithaca and who is interested romantically in Paul's soon to be divorced mother, Elizabeth Stephens. It is in that want to impress Elizabeth through Paul that John invites Paul to Medatomics, a medical research facility, so that he can demonstrate some of those ""wow"" type experiments on which he and his colleagues are working. While impressed enough, Paul is nonetheless more interested in something else in the facility that John only makes passing reference to when asked, that ""green goo"" which in combination with other things Paul discovers around the facility making him believe that the facility really a secret government nuclear one, the green goo radioactive material for atomic bombs. Paul and his classmate/girlfriend Jenny Anderman, an aspiring journalist, want to expose Medatomics for what they believe it to be as there was no community notification about operating a potentially dangerous nuclear facility there. While Jenny wants to go the traditional route in writing an exposé, Paul believes there is only one effective way to get their message across to the world while making them both famous. The further Paul, with Jenny's help, gets to enacting his plan to its intended end, the more he may place their lives and that of the community in danger, especially if the authorities discover what he is doing."
"Will Graham (William Petersen), an ex-F.B.I. profiler, quit the job because of the toil his last case, that of serial killer, psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox), took on him. Despite his work directly leading to Lecktor being captured and incarcerated, working on the case not only almost took Will's life, but also his sanity, as he needed to get into psychopathic Lecktor's mind. Will is coerced by his old boss, Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina), to return to work to assist with a new case of a serial murderer coined by the media as the ""Tooth Fairy"" (Tom Noonan). The Tooth Fairy has thus far committed two sets of murders, in consecutive months on the night of the full moon. Both sets of murders, occurring in different cities, were of families in their own houses, the family matriarch in each case was the person the Tooth Fairy seemed to place special attention. Will agrees to the job in part because he too is a family man, he assuring his loving wife Molly Graham (Kim Greist) that he will only examine the evidence and not get immersed psychologically into the case like he did last time. Will can't help but consult Lecktor on the case in needing once again to understand the mind of a psychopathic serial killer. Adding to the complexity of the case is Freddy Lounds (Stephen Lang), a reporter with a national tabloid, he who not only sensationalized the Lecktor case, but also capitalized on Will's mental decline during that case. Lounds cannot help but once again try to find something salacious on which to write with Will's involvement in the ""Tooth Fairy"" case. The case may end up being personal against the other for Will and the ""Tooth Fairy"", especially as Will discovers some ties, either direct or indirect, back to Lecktor. What neither Will nor the ""Tooth Fairy"" probably imagined is the entrance of an unexpected person into their lives that may affect what happens. All this becomes more and more important as the next full moon approaches."

"It's the mid-eighteenth century. Unlike his predecessor who was murdered and crucified for his efforts by the people in question, Father Gabriel, a Jesuit priest, is able to gain the trust of the Guaraní to build a mission in their region, above the falls in the border area of Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, so that he can bring the word of a Christian god to the Guaraní. Father Gabriel's predecessor's fate was not only because of the Guaraní 's mistrust of him, but their mistrust of the white man in general, they who had previously pilfered many native South American tribes for slaves. Someone who unexpectedly joins Father Gabriel's order in building the mission is Rodrigo Mendoza, a mercenary and slave trader, who is trying to pay penance and repent for some past actions, most specifically an incident involving his half-brother. Father Gabriel's work and the lives of the Guaraní are threatened with the arrival into the area of Cardinal Altamirano, who must decide on the fate of the mission based on the fact that the land on which the mission sits has been ceded by the Spanish to the Portuguese, who are open to enslaving the indigenous peoples as opposed to the Spanish who officially banned the practice despite the former work of people like Mendoza. Cardinal Altamirano will factor into the equation of his decision that the Portuguese may take action against the church as a whole if this one mission is not closed. Father Gabriel and the order have to decide how to proceed, with the possibility that he and Mendoza will end up on different sides of the fence. Mendoza has vowed obedience to Father Gabriel in becoming a priest but may have definite and extreme views based on previously being a mercenary and slave trader. Meanwhile, Father Gabriel wants to protect the Guaraní under the name of God, they who have converted and who are in this position largely because of him."

"This film, based on a book written by Michael Ende (the German author who also wrote ""The Neverending Story"") takes place in a fictional, nameless town. The routine, slow-paced life of the townspeople is interrupted with the arrival of Momo, a seemingly orphaned girl without a past who quickly becomes a favorite of all of her neighbors. Among Momo's inexplainable gifts is her power of observation, with which she soon notices that something drastic is happening in the town. All of a sudden, the formerly kind, patient townspeople become obsessed with saving time and money and no longer have time for their friends, especially Momo. Momo soon finds out that those responsible for this are the ""Grauen Herren"", or the gray men, a group of ghost-like gentlemen who alienate Momo and her friends and are somehow stealing their saved-up time and using it to continue their own existence. After Momo tries to convince her friends of the existence of the gray men, she must flee from the town before she is abducted by the gray men. Momo finds protection in the mysterious home of Meister Hora, an old man who explains what exactly time is and confides in her that he is in control of time. After she realizes what a gift, as opposed to a chore, time is, Momo rushes home and attempts to gather what friends she has left together and convince them of the evil that the gray men are bringing to their quiet town."
"Under the opening titles, we see a man crossing a bridge in London carrying a package. He stops off at a florist and picks up a bouquet. When he arrives at his destination, a rowhouse in a lower-class neighborhood, he knocks on the door. A teenage girl in a school uniform answers the door, but the encounter is swiftly interrupted by her mother, who comes out shouting and cursing at him. He responds in kind, and by the time she's closed the door on him for good, a crowd has formed in the street. The man nearly gets into a fight with one of the neighbors, but another man pulls him out of the whole thing.
The man's name is George, played by Bob Hoskins. The teenager is his daughter Jeannie, played by Zoe Nathenson, and the man who rescued him from the fight is his best friend Thomas, played by Robbie Coltrane. Thomas has been keeping in touch with George, largely through sending him mystery novels. George complains that in some of them it's far too easy to figure out who the murderer is, and often posits alternate, better solutions to the stories. We learn over time that George is a low-level gangster who has been in jail for seven years, and it's likely that he went up because he took the heat for someone else's deeds. That ""someone else"" is Denny Mortwell, a big-league player in the local prostitution scene, and he's played by Michael Caine. Because George took that heat, however, he thinks that Denny owes him something, so he spends some time looking for Denny, but apparently he's out of the country at the moment. However, he's given a job to do by one of his capos. He's to be the driver and bodyguard for what we can only assume is a very high-priced call girl named Simone, played by Cathy Tyson. Simone is very hostile to George at first, and it may be because he's rather uncouth and outspoken, and he's hostile to her because he thinks she's putting on airs. She gives him money to get a decent outfit, and the clothes he picks out are no better than the ones he had on previously. Later on they go out shopping for something more suitable. We see a friendship start to grow between the two, but it's still somehow guarded on her side. Occasionally, between jobs, she has him drive to King's Cross, which is one of those areas where the hookers openly solicit customers. As they drive through, she appears to be looking for something, but she doesn't say what. At one point George notes that a couple of the girls are his daughter's age, and when one girl approaches him and he turns her down, she begins to abuse him verbally until her pimp shows up. From his car seat, George beats up the pimp and they drive off.
Later, in her apartment, Simone tells him why they keep going down to King's Cross. In her past, she was one of the girls down there. She had a pimp named Anderson, who would beat her regularly. She had a single friend down there, a young girl named Cathy, who also worked for Anderson. She'd promised to take care of Cathy, but at one point she took the opportunity to escape. She ran away to Brighton and discovered a whole other level of clientele. When she returned to London she realized that these bigger fish also existed there, so she began working on her own, though Denny was finding the clients for her. But she's haunted by the fact that she left Cathy behind and keeps looking for her, knowing that the lifespan of a girl at King's Cross is likely to be limited, especially when they're working for a guy like Anderson. She enlists George's help to find Cathy, reasoning that he'd have an easier time moving through that part of town.
George meets up with Denny and Denny gives him a little lecture on the nature of happiness. He then says that what makes him happy are the small details in life. To that end, he wants George to find out what Simone does when she's with her clients, presumably as a means of blackmailing them or otherwise using the information as leverage.
In between all of this, George has occasional encounters with his daughter Jeannie, by picking her up at school and driving around a little bit, talking with her before dropping her off near her home. Jeannie has no idea why George disappeared for seven years, but she's eager to have him back in her life. George keeps drawing mental parallels between Cathy, who's about Jeannie's age, and Jeannie, and thinks about what could have happened while he was away. And in the meantime, he's increasingly torn between his loyalty to Denny and his affection for Simone. At one point he literally asks her what she does with a client, and she tells him that they drink tea and do nothing else. To underscore the lie, she has someone take a couple of Polaroid pictures of her serving out tea and has them sent to George while he's waiting for her. When George reports back to Denny that she's having tea and actually has photographic proof, Denny gets furious at him and tells him to get his head back in the game.
Now, in between his chauffeuring jobs, George also delivers packages for Denny to various places in the red-light district, so he's been looking for Cathy on the sly. At one point he thinks he's getting close to her but it turns out to be another teenager who bears a superficial resemblance to Cathy. George tries to ""rescue"" her but is unsuccessful. On another delivery trip, he spots a porno tape and tries to buy it, but the owner just gives it to him. When he gets an opportunity, he plays the tape and his suspicions were right: it's Simone in the video, giving oral sex to a man. George confronts Simone about the video and she confirms that the man in the video is Anderson. He's played by Clarke Peters.
Anderson tracks Simone down to her apartment, and tries to slash her, cutting George's arm instead. They manage to get away from him and he stashes her in Thomas' place, which is basically a secluded garage where he works on cars and deals in buying and selling various knickknacks. Because Thomas can get stuff, George asks him if he can procure a gun.
George then goes out and locates Cathy at Denny's house. He takes advantage of a hidden door to sneak her away from her client, but she's badly addled by heroin. It's clear that she's deeply addicted to the stuff. He takes both girls to a hotel in Brighton, and Cathy is in the early stages of withdrawal. Simone sends George to a pharmacy for some drugs to help Cathy, and he gives her the gun, just in case.
Later on, he and Simone go for a walk on the boardwalk. Early on, they get into an argument but he finally gets the whole story out of her: Simone and Cathy aren't just good friends, they're lovers. Suddenly Simone spots Anderson nearby on the boardwalk and the chase is on. Eventually George manages to get away from both Anderson and his henchman, but they know where everyone is staying, so he knows that they won't be safe for long. In fact, it's not long after they get back to the hotel that the gangsters catch up with them. A fight ensues and Simone winds up shooting both of them dead, but then in the heat of the moment she points the gun at George. George is infuriated and strikes her, then takes the gun and leaves.
Sometime later we see George, who's now basically free of his obligations to whatever remains of Denny's organization, and Thomas working together under a car, when we see a pair of female feet walk up. It turns out to be Jeannie, who's still rebuilding her life with her father. The two of them walk out of the garage, chatting happily."

He generally doesn't care about the political stripes of his clients, he only caring about getting the job done which will ensure his continuation in the business. Pete used to work for Wilfred Buckley until a professional disagreement led to Pete deciding to start his own consulting business, Wilfred who is now a friendly rival for the same pool of clients. During what is a midterm election year, Pete has among his clients: Washington Governor Andrea Stannard who is being attacked by her main opponent for her personal home situation rather than her politics; wealthy New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Wallace Furman, whose main obstacles to an election night win are not being a native New Mexican and having little personal charisma; and Roberto Cepeda, a Presidential candidate in a strife and violence-ridden but oil-rich South American country. Pete, however will not be working on the campaign of his friend Ohio Senator Sam Hastings, who is retiring due to an undisclosed serious health issue. That retirement leads to Pete being sought out by political neophyte Jerome Cade, who is looking to win Hastings' vacated seat. Cade portrays himself as a newer version of the popular Hastings except for one fundamental difference. Pete was approached to work on Cade's campaign by Arnold Billings, who operates his own PR firm with Cade one of his clients.

Beyond his research, teaching and writing, his life is preoccupied by fencing, attending to his delusional mother, Cecelia Burgess, and navigating a relationship with Literature professor Gretchen Carlsen, she resisting his request to move in together, while he can see that she probably wants to get married instead. Because of the authenticity in locations, a Hollywood movie crew descends on the town to film a version of Michael's novel, Sweet Liberty, he proud of its historical accuracy and its accessibility to readers who may not be familiar with the American Revolution. While most in town become star struck in all that the movie means, the one noticeable exception is Michael upon discovering that the script has little to nothing to do with his book, including not being historically accurate. Screenwriter Stanley Gould, known more for being a hack, accepts Michael's assistance in rewriting the script in seeing it as his transition to the A-list, and as such being the liaison to those that matter, namely Director Bo Hodges, and stars Elliott James and Faith Healy. Bo solely wants to make a movie that caters to the lowest common denominator of the movie-going public, but Stanley knows the way to Bo is through Elliott and Faith who have more clout. Michael and Stanley may have some issue with Elliott, who likes to exemplify his hyper-masculine on-screen persona in his personal life, especially as it pertains to the opposite sex despite being married. The issue with Faith is that Michael starts to fall for her, he arguably falling for her characterization, how he depicted her in his book, rather than Faith as a fully formed human being, one shaped by being a famous Hollywood actress."

"January, 1944 in Nazi-occupied France. From their Paris home, preteen Julien Quentin and his older, teenaged brother François Quentin have just returned to the all-boys boarding school at St. Jean de la Croix - a Carmelite convent - following the Christmas break. Outwardly, they are sent to boarding school because of the war, which is not to say that they may have been sent there regardless by their overbearing mother and absentee father, who they have not seen in two years as he works in Lille. Julien, generally looked up to by his classmates and respected by his teachers, likes to appear tough to his classmates, while in reality he is closer to being a scared little boy, a side of himself he is not afraid to show to his mother. A manifestation of the child side of himself is that he still occasionally wets his bed, something he hides in cleaning up before others awaken. The direct day-to-day issues of the war generally do not enter the school, and as such the boys are generally able to act like boys: they roughhouse (largely under the supervision of the teachers), and take advantage of getting care packages from home - which they are supposed to share in the Christian spirit - to trade with Joseph, an older boy who works in the kitchen, for things they really want, such as cigarettes. This term, three new boys enter the school, one, Jean Bonnet, who is the same age as Julien and as such is assigned to Julien's class. Jean is Protestant and is therefore exempt from many of the Catholic rituals of the convent, such as communion. Beyond his name being easy to ridicule (""Easter bonnet""), Jean is treated as an outsider by his classmates due to his reserved nature. However, Julien slowly begins to see in Jean aspects of himself, that familiarity which eventually blossoms into a friendship between the two boys. That friendship is strengthened when Julien learns the secret reason behind Jean being at the school. This term will also show Julien what the Nazi persecution means to general French life, events at the school which will be part of him for the rest of his life."

"There is an anachronism: The $1 bills depicted are Federal Reserve Notes, which weren't put into circulation until 1963. Furthermore, it appears that the director was aware that in 1957, the phrase ""In God We Trust"" had not yet become standard on the reverse side of all U.S. currency, because most (if not all) the bills shown are face up. I consider it unrealistic that a bunch of gamblers around a craps table would all have their money face up when thrown onto the table. It appears that those bills are contemporary (i.e., from the era when the film was made), and therefor would have had the phrase on the reverse. The director was apparently not aware that the $1 bills in circulation at that time were nearly all silver certificates."

"The previous synopsis is incorrect - the ghost inhabits the body of a movie dummy, not an alien - overall, a movie worth watching. Basically the story of a guy getting cheated out of his inheritance, and going after it,
with the help of a ghost, who also needs his help. The special effects are worth watching,
and the acting was actually fairly good.
The plot was a bit thin, but still enjoyable. It is always fun for me to watch the efforts of those making these types of films over 25 years ago. Before the big budget special effects we can do now with CGI and such.
It is also worthwhile to note that some of these actors went on to do much greater works,
and that this was where they honed their talent, among other performances they had already done."

"Now on the far side of middle age, Bill Rowan remembers back to his growing up period in suburban London during WWII, he ten years old when the war broke out. Beyond his father Clive enlisting and what his absence meant, Bill saw the war as an adventure, the specific events more anticlimactic for him compared to the fear driven into the populace of what could happen.

While his younger sister Susie was too young to comprehend fully what the war meant, his mid-teen sister Dawn went on as a teenage girl with raging hormones is apt to focus on, namely boys, or in wartime young men of the military variety, she often feigning the option of death compared to not being with someone, most specifically a Canadian soldier training nearby. And while Bill's mother Grace was ill-prepared emotionally to be without Clive, she had to grow up quickly to deal with leading the family through the changing times. With Dawn, Grace could see her own teen period a bit more clearly due to the war and what she would have done differently if she had to do it all over again."

Embarrassed by their dated, well-worn clothing, the girls find solace by the lake, spending hours there every day near the train bridge, reading and playing.

"Polly Vandersma, an unsuccessful and somewhat talented photographer leads a solitary life in a Toronto apartment with her photos as the only décor and her bathroom-turned-darkroom as her one friend. She's neither self-absorbed or bleak, instead content within the fantastic visions she experiences when her image emerges in the developer. Her toothpaste factory job is a failure and she's a lousy typist, but life takes a turn when she lands a part-time secretarial job in a downtown art gallery working for the french curator Gabrielle, a woman as elegant, self-composed and concerned with ""important art"" as Polly is awkward, unsophisticated and dumbfounded by ""gallery art."" As a foil to Polly's innocent joy in the minutiae of the ordinary world, the failed artist Gabrielle is desperate to create ""just one truly beautiful thing"" before she dies. Polly's first person narration in this 1987 low budget film, juxtaposed with the director's view of her photographic antics, creates an insight into the odd world in which she's fallen a la a very modern day public radio program examining one's internal views and external outcomes. In the cross-hairs of Polly's and Gabrielle's lives, the film examines the age old ideas of what is love and art? What is talent and worth?"

After the first highly publicized relationship, Sonny was dubbed ""The Woo Woo Kid"" by the press. And despite the press resulting from the first relationship after which Sonny vowed not to get involved with an older woman ever again, he met Francine which started the cycle all over again.

"""I'll look at you, but not at the camera. It could be a trap,"" whispers Jane Birkin shyly into Agnès Varda's ear at the start of JANE B. PAR AGNES V. The director of CLEO FROM 5 TO 7 and VAGABOND once again paints a portrait of a woman, this time in a marvelously Expressionistic way. ""It's like an imaginary bio-pic,"" says Varda. Jane, of course, is the famed singer (""Je t'aime ... Moi non plus""), actress (BLOW UP), fashion icon (the Hermes Birkin bag) and longtime muse to Serge Gainsbourg. As Varda implies, JANE B. PAR AGNÈS V. abandons the traditional bio-pic format, favoring instead a freewheeling mix of gorgeous and unexpected fantasy sequences. In each, Jane inhabits a new character, playing a cat & mouse game with Varda as they explore the role of the Muse and the Artist, all the while showcasing the multifaceted nature of Birkin's talent. ""I'd like to be filmed as if I were transparent, anonymous, like everyone else,"" says Birkin. But her wish to be a ""famous nobody"" is impossible to achieve; Birkin is simply too magnificent, too mesmerizing. Here, Varda's signature mix of aesthetic innovation and generosity of emotion results in a surreal and captivating essay on Art, Fame, Love, Children and Staircases. For its first-ever U.S. theatrical release the film has been newly-restored from the original 35mm camera negative, overseen by director Varda herself."

"Centering around the word No Thing . Jean Luc Godard a stalwart of the French New Wave superimposes his eccentric avant garde experimentalism A Study based on the Classic Shakespearean tragedy King Lear in a modern contextual interpretation . The film follows a non-linear plot structure as referred Shot In The Back in the intertitle . Godard brings forth his personal approach rendering a modern re- interpretation and his subjective re-construction. Peter Sellars a descendant of the legendary playwright William Shakespeare sets forth to revive his ancestors lost art in a world post the Chernobyl disaster. He discovers his characters under mysterious circumstances at a hotel in Nyon Vaud, Switzerland ( the locale is alluded as a mystical place in between France and Germany with sea and the woods). Don Learo and his daughter Cordelia substitute the father-daughter duo of the Shakespearean classic suffering from a similar or identical Hamartia, a tragic flaw so ingrained in the father-daughter relationship as the existential fight between Power versus Virtue. The outcome or the end is predictable, as Cordelia succumbs failing to express her love for her father. The lack of not having her heart in her mouth suffocates her in awkward circumstances depicted through her internal psychological conflict, brooding silence and disinterested appearance. Her inability or inexpression tortures her father intolerably as he attempts over the time to silence her silence. The No Thing or Nothing of Cordelia results in a faulty meaning generation owing to her fathers incapacity of acceptance and understanding, rather- misinterpreting her silence as a lack of love, leading to the tragic conclusion too late to rectify. Other alternate character additions worth mentioning- Professor Pluggy (starring Godard himself) a frenzied clairvoyant substitute of the Shakespearean Fool , obsessed with photocopying his own hand, whose strangely mysterious last words bear an uncannily absurd co-incidental reference to the name of the film editor Mr Alien featuring in the end. Godard also incorporates Shakespeares paranormal elements in the form of four shadowy human-like figures imitating and following the central characters everywhere ( as depicted in first half when Peter scribbles on a notepad whilst walking around the woods seeking inspiration the human goblins emulate and follow him ) . Godard surpasses nudity with this one, as he barely includes any intimate sequence or moments. As his character Peter is subjected by Cannon Films ( a film production company incidently the films producer )to exclusively exclude any form of nudity from his creative themes thus directing his interest in the father-daughter conversations patronising them as his central characters. The camera work and cinematography is well conceived opening new perspectives. The mise en scene is seamlessly blended as thematically the desolate tourist location is ideal, merging the backdrop smoothly into the plot .But the real show stealer are the ground breaking dialogues, interesting sound bits ( of screeching sea gulls ), intense voice-overs and critical soliloquies as the plotline gains its much momentum from the audio sound bits and the voice-overs helping in character introspection giving psychological insight in the characters mental state .Reference clippings of Renaissance artworks of Michaelangelo with some French Impressionism along with special emphasis on The Girl With A Pearl Earring of Johannes Vermeer and paintings of Francisco Goya, etc are focused through a candle flame depicting the necessity of art revival in the modern world interests .However, Godard successfully brings forth his subjective approach and personal interpretation though faltering significantly in generation of audience response and interests.. As the film defaults into a haphazardly non-linear structure at times losing track and audience interest ( although partially attempted to regenerate through the loud sound bits and uncanny voices) .The film lacks outlined character structure devoid of solidity appearing more absurd in nature. Whereas, the film plot appears less concrete or adapted and is more alluding, suggestive in nature and could have garnered impact throgh better execution .Though Godard efforts to explain the films thematic ideation through the incessant use of intertitles , which can be deemed significantly important in imparting his inference to the audience facilitating a better understanding and acceptance of the film as a personal alternative approach or a referential study . A subjective reconstruction based on the original play. A true enough Clearing and Loathing, Godard puts forth his personal cinematic take on the Classic.

"Ed. Notes:
The film makers slightly altered the time line of Pu Yi's early life.
Re, The Emperor of China, 1908: Pu Yi was only two years of age when he was invested.
Re, Brothers, 1914: The wall, from which Pu Chieh points to the president of China and which is clearly under construction, was actually constructed in 1912, thus, Pu Yi would have been only six years of age and his brother would have been five.
Re, Education, 1919: Pu Yi would have been only thirteen years of age and his brother would have been twelve.
Wan Jung was nicknamed Elizabeth at the American missionary school in Tientsin which she attended as a girl.
Pu Yi was jocularly nicknamed Henry, after Henry VIII and as suggested by Pu Yi's relationship to Elizabeth, by Reginald Johnston.
Pu Yi's Manchu clan name was Aisin Gioro (Gold Clan) but he would not have been called Aisin Gioro Pu Yi as clan names are not used in that manner.
Pu Yi's name is also often spelled ""Puyi"".
Pu Chieh's name is also often spelled ""Pujie"".
After leaving Pu Yi's service in 1924, Reginald Johnston became commissioner of the British Weihaiwei lease located at the end of the strategic Shandong Peninsula until that prefecture was returned to China in the autumn of 1930.
Eastern Jewel (Dongzhen) was the courtesy name for Yu Aixinjueluo (or Xianyu) of the Manchu Aisin Gioro.
She was a Qing princess and a distant relative of Pu Yi.
She was raised in Japan where she was called Yoshiko Kawashima.

"Joanna and Grant Stayton III are an extremely wealthy, pretentious couple who live aboard their yacht. They live off of Joanna's family's money. She is a bitch of a woman, who treats others poorly and thinks nothing about doing whatever she needs to get what she wants, which she always gets. So when their yacht is moored in Elk Cove, Oregon and she hires local carpenter Dean Proffitt to do some work, she has no qualms of stiffing him the $600 for the job when it doesn't meet what she wanted, despite her not specifying the issue to him beforehand. When she and Grant sail out of Elk Cove, she falls overboard, the resulting injury which causes temporary amnesia. Grant sees this accident as his opportunity to ditch her. When news of a Jane Doe (Joanna) hits the local news and Dean sees that the person he knows as Grant denies knowing her, he also sees an opportunity: he will claim to be her husband and make her his housemaid - which includes her taking care of his four rambunctious sons - for about a month, which he considers the equivalent of what she owes him. ""Annie"" (what they end up calling her) is still a bitch of a woman. As time goes on, Dean has second thoughts about what he is doing, not because of Annie being like Joanna, but because he is falling in love with her and it seems like she is doing vice versa. Can their love overcome the obstacles of her equally pretentious mother looking for her, or the time when she will ultimately regain her memory?"

"The film Repentance begins with a woman baking cakes designed to look like churches and moments later discovering that a man, Varlam Aravidze, has died. It's rather obvious that she isn't sorrowful over the death, unlike her male companion who cries that he was ""a great man"". The film moves forward to Varlam's funeral, with a line of people moving before Varlam's family and sharing their condolences. Varlam's grandson is the only one who seems genuinely saddened by his passing. Following his funeral and burial, Varlam's corpse is soon unearthed and propped up against the tree outside his son, Abel's, residence, much to the family's horror. In response the authorities arrest Varlam's corpse. At the advice of his ""fool"" neighbor, Abel decides to rebury Varlam but to contract a cage around his grave. The next morning Varlam's corpse in unearthed once again and sat casually at a table in Abel's backyard. After this the police stand guard overnight and quickly discover the culprit responsible- it's the woman who was baking cakes at the start of the film. We find out that the woman's name is Keti Barateli, and she was the daughter of an artist named Sandro and his beautiful wife, Nino. Keti recalls Varlam being elected mayor when she was 8 and her father taking issue with Varlam's use of their ancient church for experiments that are ruining the infrastructure of the cathedral. Sandro argues that the destruction of the church means the destruction of the history and culture that give life to their people. He says destroy the church, ""then throw into fire the works of Rustaveli and Dante! Stop playing Bach, Beethoven, Verdi. Let's demolish the St. Peter Church, Notre Dame, Svetitskhoveli."" Varlam appears to give in a bit to those imploring him to maintain the safety of the church but then threatens Sandro by casually informing him he know's where he lives and saw his young daughter (8 year old Keti) blowing bubbles during his mayoral parade. He then proceeds to arrest the two people who had joined Sandro to argue on behalf of the church, but shortly after it is said that they were released. Varlam then show's up at Sandro's apartment and hits on his wife and gives Keti some birds before sending her off to play with his son Abel. Varlam begins to tell Sandro that he needs and artist like him to enlighten the people and culturally enrich them, to which Sandro replies that people can only be enlightened by a spiritual pastor. Keti and Abel and shown looking at a crucifix and Keti is explaining Jesus to Abel and how he is alive in heaven- Abel asks about his diseased mother and whether Jesus could revive her. Nino overhears and tells young Abel that his mother is alive in heaven. Varlam then performs William Shakespeare's Sonnet 66, stating ""a regime is a regime"" before exiting Sandro's apartment through the window with his men and his son. Moments later Varlam returns and explains that Abel took the crucifix believing it could revive his mom- he gives it to Nino saying ""take care of it, this is a very valuable thing.""
Nino has a dream where she and Sandro are being chased through the town by Varlam and his men and then out into a field where they attempt to hide by burying themselves in dirt before being discovered by Varlam who then sings the same song he had performed in their apartment earlier that evening. She wakes and tells Sandro that they must leave town, and Sandro reassures her that there is nothing they could be arrested for. Seconds later the doorbell rings and two of Varlam's soldiers tell Sandro he must come with them while they begin taking Sandro's art from his walls. Varlam then argues with Sandro's friend Mikhail Korisheli (who is also the local Party Secretary) after Mikhail dismisses a letter detailing Sandro's arrest as ridiculous. Varlam informs Mikhail that he and Sandro are related and says he is the enemy now- in response, Mikhail slaps Varlam.
Nino and Keti go with a slip of paper to a line presumably meant to tell them information on Sandro's wellbeing. A woman and her daughter hand over their paper and give their name and are told ""the parcel was received"" and the woman is relieved to the point of tears before walking away satisfied. The next woman is told whoever she is looking for has been exiled and she begins to argue and cries ""just tell us he's dead!"" Nino and Keti hand over their paper and are told Sandro has been exiled (so he has most likely been killed.)
We unsurprisingly learn that Mikhail has been arrested and Nino is left in a room alone with pictures of Varlam on sticks from his parade. She throws one on the ground and jabs it with a stick before noticing Varlam is standing in the room with her. She immediately stops and begins to praise him before falling to her knees and begging for him to help her; he responds by walking away. Soon after we see Keti and Nino searching a lumber yard for Sandro's body. Next we see Sandro being questioned in a garden by a piano-playing tuxedo-ed man and accompanied by a blindfolded woman holding the scales of justice. They bring out Mikhail who agrees he was a member of an organization attempting to dig a tunnel from Bombay to London and that Sandro was also a member. The tuxedo man leaves them to talk in private, leading the blindfolded woman with him. Mikhail has a sort of psychotic episode and collapses while Sandro sadly looks on. Varlam is shown giving an erratic, fear-inspiring speech to the town and then we see Nino being comforted by Yelena that Sandro would be released soon. Sandro is then shown being executed and the church is blown up right after.
Doksopulo alerts Varlam that he has arrested a truckload of people all with the same last name for him, happily saying he'd brought him ""a truck full of enemies."" At first Varlam snaps to release all of them and apologize and demands for Doksopulo's resignation, before changing his mind and arresting them all after all, allowing Doksopulo to keep his job.
Varlam's assistant visits Nino and Keti and gives them train tickets, telling her Varlam's men would be coming for them tonight. Moment's after Varlam's assistant leaves, his mom appear and take Nino and Keti.
It finally returns to the courtroom where Keti demands Varlam not be buried, for ""to bury him is to bury what he did.""
Varlam's grandson, Tornike, has a dream (?) that he's in a concrete enclosure with Varlam where he's threatening to kill the sun, before dying. Abel finds Tornike alone, still seated in the courtroom. He obviously, unlike the rest of his family, believed Keti's story. Him and his father argue over the kind of man Varlam was and Tornike tells Abel he hates him before exiting the room. Tornike is then shown laying in bed that night, while a doctor tells his parents he is in shock. He imagines Varlam laying in a casket as if it were a bed while a woman dances above him.
In court they argue over the sanity of Keti and Abel looks pensive. That night he goes into his basement where a crucifix is placed on the wall and asks for a confession from a priest that is pictured eating a raw fish while Abel confesses to him. Abel says he is worried about his faith- the priest responds that Abel is not concerned about good and evil and that it is his fear that is killing him. He admits to being afraid of himself and the kind of person he is. The priest then tells him he's a coward and that if it were up to him he would send Abel straight to hell. Abel get's angry and asks who he is and it's revealed that the priest was Varlam who says ""so you came to confess to the devil?"" and laughs. Abel is viably shaken at court, holding the skeleton of the fish Varlam had been eating. Keti says during court that Varlam continues to live as long as people continue to defend him. Tornike comes to visit her in her cell and asks for her forgiveness. She tells him they're putting her in an insane asylum and he confronts his father about it- they argue and his father slaps him. Tornike proceeds to kill himself in his room. Abel then throws his father's body off of a cliff.
It then returns to the kitchen scene from the beginning, and a woman on the street stops and asks Keti through her window is the road leads to a church. Keti replies ""No, this is Varlam Street and it doesn't lead to a church,"" to which the woman replies ""Then what do you need it for? Why have a road that doesn't lead to a church?"" before walking away."
"Commandant Eric (George Gaynes) Lassard decides that the police force is overworked and understaffed, so he comes up with the idea of recruiting civilian volunteers to work side by side with his officers in a program called ""Citizens On Patrol"" (COP).

"When he's ready, Dutch lights a crude torch and sounds out a primitive yell, summoning the alien and dropping the torch onto a large bonfire he'd built. The alien arrives and crawls over the unseen Dutch. Dutch fires one of his explosive arrows at the creature, permanently disabling its invisibility device. However, Dutch rapidly runs out of weapons. The alien captures him in a pond. After a brief examination of his human opponent, the creature removes its helmet, revealing its face: deep set eyes, a bald head, deeply-set eyes, dreadlocks, and a fang-filled mouth with large mandibles. It engages Dutch hand-to-hand, a battle where the alien has the advantage of strength over Dutch. Dutch draws the creature into the spiked trap he'd set, yelling for it to come closer to kill him. The creature discovers the trap and walks around behind Dutch. As it moves in, Dutch notices it's standing directly under the trap's counterweight; Dutch kicks away the trigger and the counterweight plummets, crushing the alien. Dutch moves in to finish it off with a large rock but throws it away when he sees that the alien is already wounded fatally. Dutch asks ""What the hell are you?"" and the creature repeats the phrase. It opens a panel on its' gauntlet and activates a timer, signaling Dutch to run. As he does, the creature laughs, imitating Billy. A small nuclear explosion goes off as Dutch leaps to cover."
"This movie is the story of the spectacular life and violent death of British playwright Joe Orton (Gary Oldman). In his teens, Orton is befriended by the older, more reserved Kenneth Halliwell (Alfred Molina), and while the two begin a relationship, it's fairly obvious that it's not all about sex. Orton loves the dangers of bath-houses and liaisons in public restrooms; Halliwell, not as charming or attractive as Orton, doesn't fare so well in those environments. While both long to become writers, it is Orton who achieves fame. His plays ""Entertaining Mr. Sloane"" and ""Loot"" become huge hits in London of the sixties, and he's even commissioned to write a screenplay for the Beatles. But Orton's success takes him farther from Halliwell, whose response ended both his life and the life of the up-and-coming playwright."

"An elderly man reads the book ""The Princess Bride"" to his sick and thus currently bedridden adolescent grandson, the reading of the book which has been passed down within the family for generations. The grandson is sure he won't like the story, with a romance at its core, he prefers something with lots of action and ""no kissing"", but he lets grandfather continue, because he doesn't want to hurt his feelings. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of ""as you wish"" to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action."

"Joe, a New York Jew, fondly recalls his growing up period in the late 1930s and early 1940s in Rockaway, Queens. He not only lived with his parents - his father who would not divulge his occupation to Joe - but also with his mother's extended family out of financial necessity. That family consisted of biological aunts, an uncle by marriage, his grandmother and a cousin. Each member of the family had his or her routine - such as his cousin Ruthie listening to the neighbors' goings-on through the telephone party line - which grounded the activities. With the diversity of those activities, what tied the family together was listening to the radio. While the adults listened to a variety of talk shows and game shows - the former often providing an escape of being able to peer into the lives of the rich and famous - Joe loved the serials, and would have done anything to get a Masked Avenger secret decoder ring, the 15-cents which he didn't have to send away for it. Joe also recalls the back stories of some of the players in the New York radio scene, one in particular, Sally White, who wanted desperately to become a radio star, who worked as a cigarette girl at a Broadway club where many radio personalities hung out, and who was saddled with a non-radio Brooklyn accent. The radio also was the conduit for breaking news, some on a global scale - such as the US entering the war following the bombing of Pearl Harbor - and some more on a personal scale, both which nonetheless kept the listener glued to the radio for the outcome. But what everyone listened to was the music, especially his single Aunt Bea who wanted to get married but who always seemed to attract the wrong type of man. Joe still places certain songs from the era with certain events in his and his family's lives. But with each passing year, those memories become less pronounced in his brain."

"Based on a true story, this low budget theatrical masterpiece opens with the background of Eastern LA. In an environment that values a quick fix over education and learning, Jaime A. Escalante is a new teacher at James A. Garfield High School determined to change the system and challenge the students to a higher level of excellence. Leaving a steady job for a lowly position as a math teacher in a school where rebellion runs high and teachers are more focused on discipline than academics, Escalante is at first not well liked by students, receiving numerous taunts and threats and often coming off as stubborn and dismissive when his students' personal problems become apparent. As the year progresses, he is able to win over the attention of the students by implementing innovative teaching techniques, using props and humor to illustrate abstract concepts of math and convey the necessity of math in everyday lives. Escalante successfully instills a value that everyone uses math everyday, whether they realize it or not. He is able to transform even the most troublesome teens to dedicated students, ready to learn. While Escalante teaches math 1A, basic math, he soon realizes that his students are capable of more than the expectations set forth by the school board. Despite concerns and skepticism of other teachers, who feel that ""you can't teach logarithms to illiterates"", Escalante nonetheless develops a curriculum in which the his students can rise to take AP Calculus by their senior year, which will earn them college credit. This intense math program requires that students take summer classes, including Saturdays, from 7 to 12, tasking for even the most devoted and committed students. While other students spent their summers ""barefoot and pregnant"", these math enthusiasts were learning complex theorems and formulas. The vast contrast between home life and school life, however, begins to show as these teens struggle to find the balance between what other adults expect of them and the goals and ambitions they hold for themselves. With Escalante to help them, they soon find the courage to separate from society's expectations for failure and rise to the standard to which Escalante holds them to, a standard of success. Taking the AP Calculus exam in the spring of their senior year, these students are relieved and overjoyed to be finished with a strenuous year. After receiving their scores, they are overwhelmed with emotion to find that they have all passed, a feat done by few in the state. Later that summer, a shocking accusation is made. The Educational Testing Service calls into question the validity of their scores when it is discovered that similarities between errors is too high for pure chance. Outraged by the implications of cheating, Escalante feels that the racial and economic status of the students has caused the ETS to doubt their intelligence and ability. Confronting the two professors sent to investigate, he blames himself because he taught a system that would produce the same errors for all his students. In order to prove their mathematical abilities and worth to the school, to the ETS, and to the nation, the students agree to retake the test at the end of the summer, months after their last class. With only a day to prepare, there is high stress to show that they have what it takes to make something of themselves. After the retake, these students truly stand and deliver when they all pass the exam again, showing they deserve all they have achieved. When Escalante and his principal receive the new scores, Escalante calmly states that he wants his students' original scores reinstated."

They look for any case that might have an impropriety. As is explained to the audience, fixing a case requires participation from both the prosecutor and the trial judge.

"Marion Post (Gena Rowlands) is a New York philosophy professor past the age of 50 on a leave of absence to write a new book. Due to construction work in their building, she sublets a furnished flat downtown to have peace and quiet. Her work there is interrupted by voices from a neighboring office in the building where a therapist conducts his analysis. She quickly realizes that she is privy to the despairing sessions of another woman, Hope (Mia Farrow), who is disturbed by a growing feeling that her life is false and empty. Her words strike a chord in Marion, who begins to question herself in the same way.
Shortly after, Marion is at her husband's 50th birthday party. In an embarrassing revelation of her friends, Marion learn that her sex life might not be as spontaneous as some others. On another morning, Marion is to meet her sister-in-law Lynn (Frances Conroy) who is running late. She wants to borrow money for their divorce. Marion's insensitivity is on display. Marion learns in that conversation that her brother, though he respects her, hates her.
On another afternoon, she overhears Hope discussing her lost chance at love in the therapist office next door. She reflects on her anniversary party where author Larry Lewis (Gene Hackman), Ken's friend, professed his love for Marion. Then Ken's ex-wife Kathy (Betty Buckley) shows up returning some items and interrupting the celebration by claiming Ken and Marion had an adulterous affair while she was in the hospital having her ovaries removed. Ken has a less than impassioned reaction and escorts Kathy out. Larry renews his pleas, but then accuses Marion of being as dispassionate as Ken.
Marion and her step daughter Laura (Martha Plimpton) travel to visit her father (John Houseman). Laura admires Marion but resents the way she handles people in her life. Old photographs spur memories of when she went off to college but her brother Paul (Dax Munna) was forced to work in a cardboard box factory. There is also a photo of her friend Claire with whom Marion has lost touch.
As they return to the city, Marion sees Hope on the street and takes off in a foot pursuit. Losing her, she runs into Claire (Sandy Dennis) and her husband Jack (Jacques Levy) exiting a theater. They head off for a drink at a bar where her husband hangs on every word Marion says. Claire is jealous and brings up the past when Claire took the attention of her boyfriend David accusing Marion of subtly flirting with him and encouraging his interest. Claire states this is the reason she withdrew from their friendship.
The next day, Hope has nothing to say in the therapist's office. Marion reflect on a poem about a black panther in a case whose only see his way out of the cage was death. Marion begins to see herself as judgmental and putting herself above others. Unable to work, she seeks out her brother Paul (Harris Yulin). He tells her that he feels she is embarrassed by him for pursuing his dreams rather than the paths of success that may have been open to him. However, at dinner that night, a former pupil tells Marion how she changed her life with the lectures in her class.
Not sleeping at night, Marion takes a rest in her workspace and has an introspective dream. First, Marion walks into the therapists office and tells the doctor that Hope's issue is she is deceiving herself. The doctor confides that she has been killing herself for most of her adult life. Then her father walks in and begins listing the regrets he has had in his life. Next, she is witnessing a scene played out on stage of her own marriage and the lack of passion in it. Then she chats with Larry Lewis and finds out about his life, his lack of regret and that she has become a character in his book. Then she is to witness her first husband's ""suicide scene"" in which his death was ruled strangulation. He felt he imparted a kind of strangulation he imparted on her, his former student, with his knowledge and opinions she seemed forced to accept. She comes to realize that, like her father, she has been unfair, unkind and judgmental to the people closest to her: her unsuccessful brother Paul and his wife Lynn, who feel they embarrass her; her best friend from high school Claire, who feels eclipsed by her; her first husband Sam, who eventually committed suicide; and her stepdaughter Laura, who admires her but resents her high-handedness.
That night Marion and Ken are out with the Banks, friends of whom they are not particularly fond. When they return home, Marion questions Ken why they don't sleep together any more. That night Marion lies awake and remember when she gave a gift to the professor who became her first husband. She remembered the mask, the only thing she could afford, and how they kissed through it.
The next day Marion is in search of an anniversary gift for her husband. She wanders into an old antique store and finds Hope sobbing. She finally manages to meet the woman in therapy as she contemplates a Klimt painting called ""Hope"". Although she wants to know more about the woman, she ends up talking more about herself, realizing that she made a mistake by having an abortion years ago and that at her age there are many things in life she will not have anymore.
When Marion returns to the work space she overhears the conversation between Hope and her therapist where Hope is describing the encounter with Marion and how she met a woman who was really sad though she wasn't in a position where anyone would think she should be. She has led this cold cerebral life without feeling. Hope worries that she will follow the same path toward an empty life if she does not change. Hope recounted to her therapist that in the midst of their lunch, that Marion noticed her friend Lydia. Upon closer inspection she saw Lydia was there with her husband displaying mutual affection for each other. In the other room, Marion begins to cry. She realizes that her marriage to her second husband, Ken, is unfulfilling and that she missed her one chance at love with his best friend Larry
At home, Ken hurries Marion to get dressed for their anniversary dinner and presents her with gift. Marion declares she isn't going anywhere. She tells Ken she saw him in the restaurant with Lydia. Ken confesses that their affair was a past thing and quite foolish. Marion says in a way she feels sorry for him because he has been as lonely as she has been, Ken doesn't realize he has been lonely, but Marion takes solace in the fact that at least she has come to recognize it.
In the days that follow, Marion gets little work done and walks in the streets. She visited her brother Paul who has chosen to stay with his wife even though they always fight. Marion seeks a clean start with Paul and Lynn. Marion walks with her step daughter and makes sure the pending divorce with her father will not affect their friendship. Marion also goes next door and tell the therapist about the acoustics that allow her to hear his patients. She inquires about Hope but Hope has left treatment and the therapist can't offer any way for Marion to meet her.
Marion resumes work on her book without interruption and it goes very well. One day she stopped to read the novel by Larry Lewis in which a character was based on Marion. In it, the narrator came to realize that Helenka (the Marion character) would certainly be loving and passionate if she put down her walls and allowed herself to feel. Marion reflects that, for the first time in years, she feels hopeful."

She has narrowed her choice to two recent acquires: Ebby Calvin LaLoosh, the wild neophyte pitcher with a wicked fastball - the pitch on which he solely relies - but can't aim, the more he thinks about it, the more erratic the pitch gets, while he doesn't appreciate anyone criticizing him or it in believing he knows best in his lack of self-awareness; and catcher Crash Davis, the veteran who has been around the minor leagues for twelve years and who was brought in solely to harness and reign in Ebby's power. While Ebby would gladly accept Annie's offer in seeing sex as an inherent part of his being, Crash, who is as philosophical in being a thinker as he is athletic, takes himself out of the running - the first player ever to do so - as, although attracted to her, does not see sex as the ""game"" she seems to treat it, especially as he knows he is nearing the end of his baseball playing career.

"In the 20th century, no artistic medium in North America with so much potential for creative expression has had a more turbulent history plagued with less respect than comic books. Through animated montages, readings and interviews, this film guides us through the history of the medium from the late 1930s and 1940s with the first explosion of popularity with the superheroes created by great talents like Jack Kirby and hitting its first artistic zenith with Will Eisner's ""Spirit"". It then shifts to the post war comics world with the rising popularity of crime and horror comics, especially those published by EC Comics under the editorship of William B. Gaines until it came crashing down the rise of censorship with the imposition of the Comics Code. In its wake of the devastation of the medium's creative freedom, we also explore EC's defiant survival with the creation of the singular ""Mad Magazine"" by Harvey Kurtzman. We then move to the resurgence of the superheroes in the late 1950's and 1960's typified with the rise of the dramatically innovative Marvel Comics edited by Stan Lee. Still more important is the rise of the the gleefully uninhibited underground comics created by eccentric talents like Robert Crumb and Dan O'Neill. These leads to profiles of creators like Harvey Pekar who take the medium into new directions of expression. In the late 1970s and '80s we see the rise of alternative comics with such bold talents like Jaime Hernández for ""Love and Rockets, Sue Coe for How to Commit Suicide in South Africa and especially for Art Spiegelman for his searing Pulitizer Prize winning Holocaust account, Maus. Finally, we learn of the medium's superhero mythos' revitalizing moment with the creation of Frank Miller's ferocious min-series ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"". Taken together, the film makes its argument that the medium is far more than the stereotype of juvenile trash but rather it is an art-form with a wild history and an exciting future."

"It is the day of the senior prom, and everybody is getting into the swing of things. First we meet Dan (Chris Young), who is buying a corsage for his ""date"", however he is not doing a very good job of it. When he leaves the florist, he runs into Patrice (Christina Applegate) and Roger (Matthew Perry). It is obvious from this confrontation that Dan is not the most popular guy in school and also that Patrice tells Roger exactly what to do. From there, we pan over to the girls, Shelly (Alyssa Milano), Lori, and Kerry, in the drug store, discussing the prom night and specifically who Shelly will be going with. She claims she will be going to a college frat party instead. They decide that Shelly will be the only senior missing the prom, until they see Angela (Traci Gold) and Margaret (Tempestt Bledsoe). These two are debating which movie to watch at the movie rental store for prom night. Then we meet the guys, Kevin (Brian Bloom) and Wallce, who are getting their tux rentals taken care of. It is then revealed that Kevin does not have a date, so Wallace claims that Angela is ""easy."" Kevin goes across the mall to ask Angela out to prom and Margaret convinces her to say yes. Then Kevin goes to buy condoms from the local drug store, whose pharmacist we find out later is Angela's dad (Kelsey Grammer). We then follow the various kids to their pre-prom routine, where Patrice is micro-managing her parent's party (Mary Frann and Cliff De Young), Dan is getting grief from his father (Alan Thicke) about being a man, Shelly is telling her family that she's really going to prom with Kevin, Angela can't find anything to wear (but she eventually finds a dress back in her mother's (Edie McClurg) closet). Kevin comes to pick up Angela, but her father remembers him from earlier at the drug store; Angela sneaks out anyway. Dan pretends to go to prom, but instead goes to an all-night movie marathon, as does Shelly. Patrice and Roger arrive at prom, with Patrice matching the prom theme (""Paris in Puce""). Angela and Kevin go out for dinner first, at a nice restaurant, with her parents following them and getting a bad table and not paying their dining check. Shelly sees some lower-leve high school students at the movie theater and tries to sneak out, and Dan stops the kids before they find out it is Shelly. Dan and Shelly then go to the Italian restaurant, but she sees Kevin and Angela and wants to leave. They then try to go to the local burger drive-thru, but she knows the drive-thru employee. Angela and Kevin arrive at the dance, with everybody not recognizing Angela until later. In the meantime, it becomes obvious that Patrice's parents, Nancy and Larry, are not enjoying their marriage and decide to start divorce proceedings the next Monday. Shelly and Kevin are announced as prom king and queen; however, since Shelly is not there, Patrice wants a revote (thinking she would get prom queen). In the meantime, Larry and Nancy start dancing to ""You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling"" by the Righteous Brothers and rekindle their romance. Angela wins the revoted prom queen contest and dances with Kevin and gets her first kiss, which her parents (who have sneaked into the dance) witness. Also, Margaret has gone back to return her previously-rented movie and get a new one and learns from the video store clerk that Kevin only asked Angela out because she is easy. Margaret goes off to find Angela at the prom. While this was occurring, Dan and Shelly went up to look at the stars and meet one of Dan's friends, a local toll booth collector. As Dan has forgotten the corsage for his ""date,"" his dad and his dad's date go to the prom looking for Dan and find out he never bought tickets. Dan's dad and the date go up to the observatory; fortunately, Dan sees them before they get too close and he and Shelly leave. Dan's dad's date is fed up with the date, and asks the toll booth collector to take her home, which he does. Dan and Shelly find the makeout point and try to hide out there, just as the people from prom are arriving there to make out. In an effort to blend in, they begin to make out with each other. Margaret has since found Angela and told her about the things she heard, but Angela doesn't want to listen and leaves with Kevin to go to Patrice's party. Patrice and Roger run out of money for the limo and are stranded, where Patrice tries to pawn off her pre-engagement ring, finding out it is a fake. Everybody arrives at her party (her parents have gone off to realize their new romance) and somebody breaks in to get the party started. Kevin tries to seduce Angela, but she criticizes him for not liking her and leaves. Her parents have been found trying to sneak into the party and are carted off to jail, as are Patrice and Roger for the noisy party. Angela goes to Margaret's house to apologize for not believing her and they make up. Everybody eventually arrives at the local pancake house for breakfast, including Patrice and Roger (who breaks up with Patrice and leaves to become a fireman), her parents (who think the breakup was a good thing), Kevin (who slugs his friends for suggesting that Angela and he went ""all the way""), Angela and Margaret (planning Angela's studies in Italy as a designer), Angela's parents (also released from jail), Dan's father (who tells the real story of how Angela's parents were married and they then tell the real story of Dan's dad's prom date), as well as Shelly and Dan, who have decided to go steady (Dan's dad presents him with his forgotten corsage) and the movie ends with Dan and Shelly kissing."

While Valmont, who is renowned as a rakish playboy, does it to prove to himself that he can have any woman he wants with love never in the equation, Merteuil does it in an effort to level the playing field between the sexes in their class, while truly enjoying the cruelty of it all. No person is immune as collateral damage in their end goals. In order to get back at Bastide, the first and only man to have ever jilted her, Merteuil wants Valmont to deflower Bastide's intended, the innocent Cécile de Volanges, Merteuil's niece who spent her teenaged years in a convent and whose mother has just released her in order for her to enter into womanhood with Bastide, about which she is unaware. Bastide would only find out about Cécile not being a virgin on their wedding night. Merteuil offers herself sexually to Valmont as a reward. Valmont, however, declines as it would be too unchallenging a task, and as he has his eyes set on another conquest, namely Madame de Tourvel, a highly virtuous married woman who is staying temporarily with Valmont's aunt, Madame de Rosemonde, at her country château. Valmont's goal is not only to sleep with Madame de Tourvel, but to get her truly to want him. As such, Merteuil decides to enlist the unwitting help of the Chevalier Danceny, a poor music teacher, in her game, she planning to maneuver Danceny and Cécile into a relationship, which in reality could never happen due to their differing social classes. Danceny taking Cécile's virginity would be a bonus as the shame to Bastide would be greater than if Valmont did so. As Valmont's own set quest is a greater challenge, Merteuil does still offer herself to him if he succeeds in seducing Madame de Tourvel. As Merteuil and Valmont spend time with this collective group in their games of sexual manipulation, they may find that their modus operandi may be forever changed, but each for different reasons."

"The second film in Terence Davies's autobiographical series ('Trilogy', 'The Long Day Closes') is an impressionistic view of a working-class family in 1940s and 1950s Liverpool, based on Davies's own family. The first part, 'Distant Voices', opens with grown siblings Eileen (Angela Walsh), Maisie (Lorraine Ashbourne) and Tony (Dean Williams), and their mother (Freda Dowie) arranged in mourning clothes before the photograph of their smiling father (Pete Postlethwaite). Soon after, the family poses in a similar tableau, but for a happier occasion - Eileen's wedding. While relatives sing at her reception, Eileen hysterically grieves for her dad, and recalls happy times of her youth. Tony and Maisie's memories, however, are more troubled. Davies intermingles and contrasts scenes like the family peacefully lighting candles in church with the brutal man beating his wife and terrorizing his young children. In 'Still Lives', set (and filmed) two years later, the siblings are settled in life, but not all happily. For Eileen, relief from her drab existence comes only when singing at the pub. With his skillfully composed frames and evocative use of music in place of dialogue, Davies creates a lovely, affecting photo album of a troubled family wrestling with the complexity of love."

Actually, Otto isn't Wanda's brother, but her latest lover, a dimwit who gets off on his own body odor and believes he's an intellectual because he reads Nietzsche and does not tolerate being called stupid by anyone. Wanda has one weakness in men which is how Otto was able to get her to be his lover: speaking Italian in seduction. Wanda and Otto plan to double-cross Georges by having him arrested for the heist while they abscond with the jewels. Wanda further plans to triple-cross Otto by eliminating him from the picture after she has the jewels. They are able to get Georges arrested with him not knowing who tipped the off the police, and implicated by elderly eyewitness Eileen Coady (Patricia Hayes). With Georges in jail, Wanda and Otto discover that he has protected his investment by moving the jewels from their agreed location to a hidden one, telling nobody where they are but offering Ken a slight hint. Georges gives Ken, an animal lover with an extreme stutter, the task of killing Mrs. Coady before she is able to testify against him, as she is the Crown's primary witness. Meanwhile, Wanda has her own plan to reach her end goal: seduce George's defense lawyer Archie Leach (John Cleese) and find out Georges' secrets about the heist, including the location of the jewels. Archie may be easy prey for Wanda's seduction, as his wife Wendy (Maria Aitken) is a self-absorbed woman who pays him little attention. Otto might throw a wrench into Wanda's plans if he finds out what she's doing."

"Hotel Terminus is Marcel Ophul's award-winning documentary work, spanning more than 70 years, three continents and 120 hours of interviews as it explores one of World War II's greatest mysteries. Klaus Barbie, a ruthless SS interrogator knowns as the ""Butcher of Lyon"", was implicated in 4,000 deaths and the deportation of 7,000 Jews from occupied France--- and then he dissapeared. Hotel Terminus traces the 40-year hunt for Barbie, a hunt initiated by the very governments that later hid him and protected his family. Klaus Barbie, a wanted Nazi war criminal, was employed by the American government as an informant in Germany. When discovery was dangerously close, Barbie was smuggled out of Europe on an underground railway with ties to the Vatican. He took refuge in South America , where his ""talents"" were employed by the governments in Bolivia and Peru. Until he was finally brought to trial in 1987, governments harbored Barbie at the same time that his crimes were being denoucned. Hotel Terminus exposes a complex web of political intrigue, collaboration and deceit almost as unforgettable as the crimes themselves."

"To the surprise of everybody involved, John Wesford's identical twin brother, Rick, arrives and claims to know his brother did not kill himself because he has seen visions of the true killer. In flashbacks, the viewer sees that Rick Wesford saw Jack Pendler killing his brother. The police humor Rick briefly, but only because his existence calls into question the eyewitness testimony that had put the identical-looking John at the scene of the crime, and Rick's suspicious knowledge of the crime scene (from his visions) make him an attractive suspect himself. Under scrutiny by the police, Rick allies himself with another of his brother's colleagues, Dr. Chris Moscari, and carries out his own investigation. He successfully identifies, tracks down, and confronts Pendler, who attacks him and is arrested. Pendler is in some regards an excellent suspect - physical evidence puts him at the scene of the final murder.

There is a reason to that - he is a dwarf himself and he used to live in one of the drawers in place known as Drawersland (Szuflandia). But now he is in what dwarfs call King Size, which means that he is no different from people. The dwarfs can live among the people completely unnoticed as long as they will drink Polo-Cocta, otherwise they would shrink back to their small form. Olgierd is one of the dwarfs that were lucky enough to gain access to Polo-Cocta, but the ruthless leader of Drawersland wants to keep all the dwarfs in the small form threating any of the Polo-Cocta drinking dwarfs as traitors. But Olgierd is forced to return to Drawersland when his friend is arrested. What sounds like completely insane story for children is in fact one of the best sci fi comedies, although you have to understand the background of the production. King Size was created in times when Poland was still a communist country and the citizens were usually unable to leave Poland on their own free will. Juliusz Machulski, author of few great comedies, managed to parody the whole communist system by turning the story into fairy-tale like production, where actors are working with giant props. A must see - great comedy that parodies any dictatorship country even in present times."

"During the age of the dinosaurs, a massive famine forces several herds of dinosaurs to seek an oasis known as the Great Valley. Among these, a mother in a diminished ""longneck"" herd gives birth to a single baby, named Littlefoot. Years later, Littlefoot plays with Cera, a ""three-horn"", until her father intervenes and tells her that three-horns don't play with long-necks, whereupon Littlefoot's mother describes the different kinds of dinosaurs: ""three-horns"", ""spike-tails"", ""swimmers"", and ""flyers"". That night, as Littlefoot follows a ""hopper"", he encounters Cera again, and they play together briefly until a large ""Sharptooth"" attacks them. Littlefoot's mother comes to their rescue, but receives fatal injuries in the process. An earthquake swallows up the Sharptooth and divides Littlefoot and Cera and other dinosaurs from their herds while some die in the process, including Littlefoot's mother, who gives her son some words of advice about finding the Great Valley before she dies that night. Confused and in grief, Littlefoot meets an old ""clubtail"" named Rooter, who consoles him. He is then guided by his mother's voice telling him to follow the sun to the Great Valley and pass several landmarks, such as a rock formation that resembles a Longneck and the ""Mountains that Burn"".
Later, Littlefoot meets a ""bigmouth"" named Ducky and a ""flyer"" named Petrie, who accompany him on his journey. Cera, who is attempting to find her own kind, finds the unconscious Sharptooth inside a ravine and mistakenly wakes him up. She escapes and bumps into Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie; she tells them that the Sharptooth is alive and pursuing them, but Littlefoot does not believe her. As Cera describes her encounter, she accidentally flings Ducky to the direction of a lone hatching ""spiketail"", whom she names Spike and inducts into the group. Seeking the Great Valley, they discover a cluster of trees, which is abruptly depleted by a herd of Longnecks. Searching for remaining growth, they discover a single leaf-bearing tree, and obtain food by stacking up atop each other and pulling it down. Cera remains aloof, but at nightfall, everyone including herself gravitates to Littlefoot's side for warmth and companionship.
The next morning, they are attacked by the Sharptooth, but they manage to escape through a tunnel that is too small for him to follow. Beyond this, they discover the landmarks mentioned by Littlefoot's mother. Cera stubbornly decides to go another way, but Littlefoot, fed up with Cera's stubbornness, refuses, and their ensuing fight leads to a schism that divides him from the others. However, when Ducky and Spike become endangered by lava, Petrie gets stuck in a tar pit, and Cera gets ambushed by a pack of ""domeheads"" (Pachycephalosaurus) who are also living in the Mountains that Burn, Littlefoot returns to rescue them. Ashamed of her fear and behavior, and reluctant to admit her mistake, Cera leaves them in tears. Later, while crossing a pond, Petrie overhears the Sharptooth nearby. The group devises a scheme to lure him to the pond and drown him in the deep side using a nearby boulder. During the ensuing struggle, a draft from the Sharptooth's nostrils enables Petrie to fly for the first time.
The plan nearly fails when the Sharptooth begins attacking the boulder while the group attempts to push it onto him. However, Cera reunites with the group, and she headbutts the boulder, causing the Sharptooth to fall into the water below with the boulder falling on him in the process. The Sharptooth momentarily takes Petrie down with him to his death, but he later emerges unharmed. Littlefoot, alone, follows a cloud resembling his mother, which guides him to the Great Valley. He is then joined by the others. Upon arrival, the five are reunited with their families: Petrie impresses his family with his newfound flight; Ducky introduces Spike to her family, who adopt him; Cera reunites with her father; and Littlefoot rejoins with his grandparents. The group then rejoins at the top of a hill and embrace each other in a hug."

The two cultures have been at war for the past 150 years, locked in a perpetual stalemate akin to World War 1 in space, with incompetent leadership on both sides. This film chronicles the first encounter of two brilliant new young commanders, Admiral Reinhard von Museal in the Empire, and Commodore Yang Wen-Li in the Alliance, both of whose leadership and tactical genius allow them to rise over the resentment of their incompetent superiors, changing the course of the War and human history forever."

"Jack Walsh is a Los Angeles based bounty hunter. It's a job he hates, he a former Chicago police officer who was, if rumors are true, run out of town by mob boss Jimmy Serrano. The reasons for his release from the force led to the dissolution of his marriage, his wife and daughter who he has not seen in nine years but who he still loves. Eddie Moscone, a bail bondsman for who Jack often works, convinces him to pick up a specific bail jumper, Jonathan Mardukas, whose whereabouts are unknown. Although Jack negotiates a lucrative contract with Eddie for this job - Eddie who will lose his business if Jonathan is not brought in within five days - Eddie believes Jonathan having been Serrano's accountant should be enough of a drawing card for Jack, Jonathan who embezzled $15 million from his mob boss. Using some contacts and a stolen ID, Jack is able to locate and capture Jonathan on the first day in New York. Out of circumstance, Jack and Jonathan are forced to travel by the proverbial planes, trains and automobiles to get back to LA as many others are also on their tail trying to get their hands on Jonathan. They include: Alonzo Mosely, an FBI agent, and his associates, who have been leading an operation against Serrano for several years; Serrano and his men who do not want to see Jonathan testify in court; and Marvin Dorfler, a rival bounty hunter who Eddie also hires just in case Jack fails, there being no love lost between Jack and Marvin. Some try to persuade Jack to give Jonathan up, using the ""carrot"" of more money than Eddie would be paying, while others have their own moles to be able to follow Jack and Jonathan's whereabouts as they snake west across the country. But the biggest obstacle in Jack getting Jonathan back to Los Angeles within five days may be mild mannered Jonathan himself. Beyond knowing he is an easy target for Serrano if he is in prison and thus who does whatever he can can either to persuade Jack not to turn him in or elude him, Jonathan, based on differences in personality with Jack including having a multitude of phobias, may drive Jack crazy and crazier the longer they are within each other's company."

"Summer in Newport, Rhode Island in 1926. A young man, a graduate of Yale, bored with the sameness of teaching, finds himself in town due to the hand of fate. Mr. T. Theophilus North offers his services as a tutor to the children of the wealthy families who have summer ""cottages"" (really mansions) along the shore of the Atlantic Ocean.
The opening finds him reading to three misbehaving children. He tries to be polite to them, but skips pages to end the ordeal. When the eldest calls him on the skipping she tells him, ""you're a hateful, ugly, horrible man and you shouldn't be allowed"". Theophilus agrees that he shouldn't be allowed, takes drumsticks away from one child, pushes another down and gives a static electric shock to the girl right on her nose. As he leaves, he suggests to their mother that they be encouraged to play with matches.
Mr. North rides a bicycle and only selectively follows the rules of polite society. He arrives at the front door of the Bosworth Cottage for an appointment with a potential client and causes a disruption that gets a maid, Sally, dressed down by Sarah Baily-Lewis. Dr. McPherson reports on her father, Mr. Bosworth's, health. Baily-Lewis, who called to get the Bible read to Mr. Bosworth before he dies, objects to Mr. North's quoted price; he offers discounts for reading in unintelligible languages. This exchange tickles Mr. Bosworth who hires North two-hours a day, three days a week.
Theophilus establishes a friendship with Henry Simmons, a gentleman's gentleman who is headman at the Venable Cottage and senior man at Amelia Cranston's boarding establishment (where all the best help live) after losing a game of nine ball at a billiard parlor. Among his many jobs, North teaches tennis lessons to a group of children who discover that he has electric hands. He also works at Mino's Chowder Shack, where he gets to eat like six fishermen.
Henry discovers him working at Mino's and shares a secret and a thing or two about Newport. He then invites North to meet Mrs. Cranston to enjoy some not so week, not peppermint, and certainly not tea. Henry and Amelia share their perspective of the Death Watch where relatives are in cahoots with a doctor to get an elderly lady or gent with money to give up their checkbook, pen, and signing power. Henry gets to sliding on the ice when he names Dr. McPherson as on retainer at the Bosworth Cottage for $15,000.
Galloper, one of the children from the tennis lesson, has Mr. North invited to read to his sister Elspeth Skeel who suffers from migraines. She asks him to touch her forehead with his magic hands and seems to be relieved of pain at his touch. Later Mr. Skeel objects to North's laying hands on his daughter and banishes him from the property.
Theophilus lives at the YMCA and is visited by Sally, the maid from the Bosworth Cottage, who warns him that Mrs. Baily-Lewis has hired a bouncer to keep him from visiting Mr. Bosworth. North bests the bouncer using jujitsu and is applauded by Bosworth's widowed granddaughter Persis Bosworth-Tennyson. Mr. Bosworth expresses his admiration of Barclay and notes that he had a home in Newport. North indicates he would enjoy visiting Whitehall with Mr. Bosworth who admits he suffers from a weak bladder and has been housebound for years. Later Theophilus offers some pills that his grandfather swears by as an ancient remedy for his problem. He also provides Mr. Bosworth with adult sized rubber pants and diapers just as the beautiful Persis arrives with tea and a formal introduction is made.
Mr. North encounters Sally at the Fourth of July celebration and they spend the day together. After dark at the fireworks display Theophilus attempts to seduce Sally, and she moans another man's name. Theophilus gets her to admit to loving Michael Patrick Ennis, III of Boston, who's family she worked for but left when the mother objected to Sally and her son's relationship. North tells Sally that she is good enough to be the wife of a Beacon Hill scion and encourages her to go back to Boston and tell Michael Patrick Ennis he said so.
Mr. North is summoned in the middle of the night to the Skeel home and asked to comfort Elspeth who is suffering from the worst migraine. Dr. McPherson objects and is invited to leave. North is invited to take a drive with Mr. Bosworth who has escaped from his home for longer and longer periods. Bosworth indicates his plan to purchase Whitehall and turn it into an academy of philosophy, to seek out deep thinkers from around the world and invite them to live and study, teach, and write at Whitehall.
Word has gotten out about what Theophilus has done for Elspeth and a group of people are waiting for his return to the YMCA seeking his curative touch. Dr McPherson swears out a warrant for the arrest of Theophilus North on a charge of practicing medicine without a license. Later a larger crowd of ailing wraiths accosts Mr. North at the Y and he escapes by climbing out a window; the crowd chases him through the city and he seeks Henry's help. Finally, he jumps off a pier and Henry picks him up in a cigarette boat to speed him away. When they return to shore the police arrest him on Dr. McPherson's warrant.
A trial is held where Dr. McPherson outlines the medical interventions Mr. North has made-prescribing pills to Mr. Bosworth and laying hands on Elspeth Skeel. Upon questioning Theophilus reveals the pills were peppermints and Mr. Skeel indicates Mr. North was acting upon his request. Mrs. Cranston makes an impassioned speech pointing out that Mr. North is thought to be a miracle worker because he takes no fee and everybody knows you can't buy a miracle. The case is dismissed and Dr. McPherson is held in contempt for demanding a conviction.
Mr. North is invited to the Venable's ball of the season and Henry canvases every butler and valet on Bellview Avenue to obtain a proper suit and accessories. Theophilus meets Buster and Amanda Venable and is introduced to their special guests, Mr. & Mrs. Michael Patrick Ennis of Boston; he realizes why he has been invited when he finds that Sally is now Mrs. Ennis. When Sarah Baily-Lewis is introduced and realizes that the maid she dressed down is now her social better, she seems to have a breakdown. Mr. Bosworth offers Theophilus the role of Trustee of his fortune which will go to the furtherance of the Whitehall Institute.
The movie ends with Theophilus asking Persis Bosworth-Tennyson to dance. He shocks her when he touches her, apologizes, and she replies that she only hopes it will happen often. They run off the terrace hand in hand and another spark ignites from the dark."

"A memorably bizarre screen version of Lewis Carroll's novel 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland', mixing one live actor (Alice) with a large variety of stop-motion animated creatures, ranging from the complex (the White Rabbit) to the incredibly simple (the Caterpillar, consisting of a sock, a couple of glass eyes and a pair of false teeth). The original story is followed reasonably faithfully, though those familiar with this director's other films won't be the least bit surprised by the numerous digressions into Svankmajer territory, living slabs of meat and all. As the opening narration says, it's a film made for children... perhaps?"

"Based on the novel of the same name by Finnish author Antti Tuuri, this delicious late-'80s comedy builds its dark humour on the stereotypical mentality of the northern part of Finland. While perhaps not as entertaining to a person unfamiliar with Finnish traditions, the brilliant acting and directing, plus the warm, beautiful Finnish summer more than make up for the cultural gap. The story begins with a group of brothers and their families coming to honour the memory of their recently-deceased father. Spending time together, opening old wounds and creating new ones--it all boils down to brotherhood. No matter what happens, brothers take care of their own. Considering that the events of the movie all take place within a 24-hour period, nothing feels rushed. The film rolls on naturally. The best part about this film is the cast that they managed to put together for the movie. Esko Salminen, Taneli Mäkelä, Vesa Vierikko, and Esko Nikkari are all well-known, extremely-talented Finnish actors, but this movie contains among the best performances of their careers. Especially Mäkelä and Nikkari are brilliant; Mäkelä's quiet and contemplative character has depth that you can just feel--and Nikkari's convincing portrayal of a town drunk. Funny, dramatic, entertaining and definitely a movie that makes you FEEL."

"John Carpenter's slow and deliberate immersion of the daunting and worrying fable of the corrupt, deceiving and indifferent economic, social and political society, that has wrapped itself around its people and who in turn have blindly accepted their fate. Multicultural in more forms than anticipated, are the leading and upwardly mobile alien race who have gelled themselves into the Human psyche and exploited it to its full potential. This is the story of an everyman, a no one, a Nada who stumbles upon their secret, via an underground movement, whose mission is to sabotage their plans and awaken the world to its sinister plans.

"Errol Morris's unique documentary dramatically re-enacts the crime scene and investigation of a police officer's murder in Dallas, Texas. Briefly, a drifter (Randall Adams) ran out of gas and was picked up by a 16-year-old runaway (David Harris). Later that night, they drank some beer, smoked some marijuana, and went to the movies. Then, their stories diverged. Adams claimed that he left for his motel, where he was staying with his brother, and went to sleep. Harris, however, said that they were stopped by police late that night, and Adams suddenly shot the officer approaching their car. The film shows the audience the evidence gathered by the police, who were under extreme pressure to clear the case. It strongly makes a point that the circumstantial evidence was very flimsy. In fact, it becomes apparent that Harris was a much more likely suspect and was in the middle of a crime spree, eventually ending up on Death Row himself for the later commission of other crimes. Morris implies that the DA's and the judge's desire for the death penalty in this case (for which Harris would have been ineligible because of his youth) made Adams a scapegoat on whom to pin this heinous crime."

In a Cinderella moment Jason hands her the slipper, introduces himself, and from that moment on he becomes obsessed with her to an almost unhealthy degree. Jason is so distracted by her, that he abandons his uncle in the middle of an important auction of antique clocks when he sees Claire sight-seeing in the auction hall (the clock theme is obviously a reference to the idea that time has stood still, or has become, at the very least, fluid here in this town, an idea further underscored by a scene where Jason wakes up late for work because the array of antique clocks in his hotel room all have the wrong time). In a scene which almost looks as if it was plucked (or ""borrowed"") from the film ""Flashdance,"" Claire arrives for her ballet audition, looks at all the other girls nervously, peeks through the audition room door and sees how difficult its going to be, then becomes even more nervous when she hears the rejected ballerina's tearful account of how poorly she was treated.

And in a moment of unintentional humor, the otherwise brilliant composer Jurgen Knieper makes the most unfortunate choice to use a tremolo string motif that sounds exactly like the ""Twighlight Zone"" theme just as Claire reveals that her name is not Claire, but ""Natalie."""

"The inquest into Gordon Ngubene's death. The courtroom is segregated by race: blacks on one side, whites on the other. McKenzie presents Gordon's teeth to the doctor who extracted them, Dr. Herzog (Paul Brooke). McKenzie questions the doctor, who testifies that he had learned from Captain Stoltz that Gordon Ngubene complained of a toothache. No, there was nothing 'noteworthy' about Gordon's appearance...he could not recall if he had used an anesthetic when he extracted the teeth...he does not recall who ordered the teeth pulled...he does recall, however, what day it is...to the 'relief' of McKenzie, who was afraid he had lost complete control of his 'faculties.' Stolz takes the stand. He testifies that Gordon Ngubene was arrested for being in possession of 'incriminating' documents. Ngubene was found hanging by a rope, tied to the window bars. A post-mortem was conducted by a police doctor. McKenzie reminds him a post-mortem was also conducted for the Ngubene family--by a doctor who had since been 'detained': Dr. Hassiem. McKenzie can present a graphologist who will testify that Dr. Hassiem's signature was forged on the official police autopsy report. The defense lawyer claims he can present several graphologists who will testify that it was not. He calls his final witness and reads his statement, which claims Gordon was in good health prior to his death. The court waits for the witness-a young man supposedly detained with Gordon--for confirmation. 'No! I signed because Captain Stolz forced me to!' He raises his shirt and reveals his back crisscrossed with lacerations. 'This is what he did to me!' McKenzie recalls Stolz to the stand and shows him photographs of Ngubene's beaten body. How does Stolz account for the lacerations across his front and back? He must have hit the bars when he tried to jump out the window, Stolz replies. 'He behaved like a wild animal.' McKenzie submits more photographs-photographs showing 'his jaw, broken; his nose, broken; his cheekbone, crushed; his eye hanging out of its socket and dangling on the crushed cheekbone; and marks and evidence of excessive burns on his genitals'-and all that while this man was trying to get out of a window?'"

"Second generation Chinese-American Ben Loy Wang grew up solely with his father Wah Gay Wang since the American exclusion laws prevented Ben's mother from emigrating to the U.S. from China. It's 1949, and Wah Gay has settled into a life in New York City without his wife, who he has not seen in twenty years. The Wang's story is similar to other Chinese-American families. As such, New York City's Chinatown is populated with old men and their now grown sons, who have few opportunities to marry into their own race. But times are now a little different. Ben, an ex-American G.I., has just returned to New York City from his mother's home town in China with his Chinese bride, Mei Oi. The meeting of Ben and Mei Oi was arranged by Ben and Mei Oi's respective parents. Mei Oi's family is much the same as Ben's, with Mei Oi's father, who she has never met, living in New York City, while Mei Oi lived in China with her mother. By happenstance, Ben and Mei Oi seem to hit it off, and even fall in love by the time of the wedding. Although the expectations for Ben and Mei Oi are the same - live a prosperous life with many children - achieving that expectation weighs heavily on the two who have their own issues. Mei Oi, for who Ben is supposed to be her primary focus, is trying to adjust to American life without the support of family or friends. And the pressures of meeting his obligations of providing for the family and the overwhelming expectation of his father and his father's friends to produce an offspring sooner than later is causing Ben not to be able to perform sexually while in that environment. Despite their love for each other, the question becomes whether Ben and Mei Oi's marriage can survive these problems."

"The film opens with Jack Baker getting dressed while a brunette, who was a one night stand, lies in bed. He is dressing in a tuxedo. She asks, ""Will I see you again?"" When he answers ""No,"" she doesn't seem particularly moved one way or the other. As he leaves, she says, ""You got great hands."" Then, as Jack walks through the streets of Seattle, the opening credits scroll across the screen. He arrives at work with two minutes to spare. Frank, Jack's brother, is in a restroom where Jack sprays his hair with Crowning Glory's Miracle Hair to conceal his age. The brothers are a duo piano team who are currently performing at the Starfire Lounge. They have been professional performers for the past fifteen years. The first number they perform is ""People."" After their performance, Frank collects their pay from the hotel's young and very condescending, assistant manager, Lloyd. Jack doesn't trust Lloyd, so he tells Frank to count the money.
When Jack returns to his apartment, Nina, a young girl from upstairs whose mother is always out with some guy, is attempting to play ""Jingle Bells"" on his piano.
At the brothers' next engagement at the Capri Hotel Luau Lounge, wearing Hawaiian shirts, they play the bossa nova classic, ""The Girl from Ipanema."" After their performance, the club's manager, Charlie, suggests they break up. He can't use them again, he says, because they have class and most people don't want class. He needs something that will draw customers, something more up-to-date.
Those comments, or criticisms, cause the brothers to consider adding a female singer to their act. At auditions to find the right singer, Monica Moran sings ""Candy Man."" She is clearly not what they are looking for, nor are several other auditionees who sing excerpts of ""My Way,"" ""Up, Up and Away,"" ""Tiny Bubbles,"" ""I Go to Rio,"" and ""I'm So Excited."" After auditioning thirty-seven girls, they are packing up when Susie Diamond stumbles in an hour and a half late. At first Frank has no intention of auditioning her, but he finally gives her a chance. She sings a soulful performance of ""More Than You Know,"" which Jack accompanies with lush harmonies on the piano. Afterwards, she asks, ""So?"" (Neither Jack or Susie seem to recognize each other or remember they have slept together.) The brothers obviously were impressed because she is hired. The next scene shows Frank nervously pacing because Susie is late for their first performance together. When she arrives, Frank doesn't like the way she is dressed, so he and Jack quickly buy her a dress and shoes that they deem more appropriate. They rush back to the Hilton Hotel Ambassador Lounge, where Susie, after some microphone problems and the brothers getting her started by singing the verse, sings ""Ten Cents a Dance,"" which is a very appropriate song for Susie considering some of her former jobs. Next a montage shows Susie and the boys performing ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" in one lounge after another. The crowds are more enthusiastic at each venue. By the end of the montage, we see a new cardboard stand-up with Susie's name and picture added to that of the brothers. When Jack goes to a club alone to get away from his brother, he hears a jazz trio play ""Lullaby Of Birdland.""
By Christmas, when Jack asks to walk Susie home, she tells him a relationship would not work with them having to work together every night.
The trio gets a booking at a swanky resort hotel. The first night, Frank is awakened at 2 a.m. by the blare of big band music coming from Susie's side of the suite (""Perdido"").
At their first performance at the hotel, Susie sings ""The Look of Love"" for dancing. Later that evening, the three performers celebrate their success on the terrace of their suite. Frank, who is getting drunk, hears a recording of ""Moonglow,"" which causes him to reminisce about Jack teaching him to dance. As a result of Jack's dance lessons, he got a wife and children. When Frank finally goes to bed, Jack and Susie dance to the song.
Soon friction arises. Frank complains about Jack's incessant smoking, but he is really upset because of his brother's growing relationship with Susie. Frank warns him to leave her alone. Later, they argue about what music to play.
Frank gets a call from his wife that Little Frank is ill and he is needed at home. Before he leaves, he gives explicit instructions about what Jack and Susie are to perform while he is away. Once he leaves, while Jack is on the balcony smoking, we hear a recording of the Duke Ellington Orchestra playing ""Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me."" During this time, Susie is seen smelling his aftershave lotion in his bathroom. Then a little later, she sees him checking out her perfume (there is also a bubble bath scene where Jack catches Susie when she slips on the sudsy floor, but that was omitted from the version viewed). Their next performance is New Year's Eve. Susie and Jack perform ""Makin' Whoopee"" (Eddie Cantor's original version was much more sarcastic than Miss Pfeiffer's). She sings the song, which warns about the dangers of married life, from on top of Jack's grand piano and sings part of the lyric directly to Jack. She ends the number by sitting on the piano bench beside him. After the countdown to midnight, she kisses him. Later that evening (or early morning), Susie and Jack are the only ones left in the room. As she talks about her former job as an escort, he begins to massage her shoulders, then, unzips her dress and rubs her back. After a passionate kiss, he lays her on a table (sexual activity is certainly implied, but not seen). Back home from their engagement at the resort, Frank, Jack and Susie meet at a diner to discuss future bookings. While Susie and Frank argue about potential places to play and song selections, Jack sits silently. When Susie walks out, Jack suggests that Frank loosen her leash.
Later, Susie finds Jack playing jazz in a dingy night club. He never notices her; he is lost in the music and is playing much more expressively. When he returns to his apartment, Susie is sitting on the steps waiting for him. Early the next morning, Susie is dressing to sneak out, but Nina comes through the window to take Jack's dog out for his morning walk. Susie finds an old photograph of Jack and Frank. The photo was taken when they were much younger and they are holding a bottle of liquor towards the camera. By this time Jack is awake and tells her the photo was taken at their first professional gig. She says she came by to tell him she has been thinking about leaving the act. Some guy wants her to sing commercial jingles. Showing no feelings at all, Jack encourages her to take the job. He says they can always find another girl.
At their next performance at the Hilton Old America Lounge, they perform ""Feelings."" Susie quits in the middle of the song; she says she just can't sing it anymore. Later, when she tells Jack she quit, just like before, he seems unfazed. She accuses him of being cold and uncaring about anything. She also tells him she saw him playing jazz at the dingy night club; ""dusting off his dreams,"" she called it. As she turns to walk away, she calls him a coward.
Frank booked the piano duo for a telethon because, he said, it would be good publicity. However, the telethon is on a small station and they are performing at 3 a.m. Just as they start to play, the telethon M.C. interrupts to announce an updated total. Jack explodes, charges the M.C. and walks out of the studio. Frank accuses him of being unprofessional and lauds himself as being the responsible one. They also argue about Susie, especially that Jack and she slept together (more explicit language was used). Their argument escalates into a fight where Jack almost breaks Frank's finger. Then before Frank can protest, Jack turns away and disappears into the night.
On the way back to his apartment, Jack stops in a diner. The waitress is Monica, who sings a bit of ""Candy Man"" to remind Jack of who she is. Jack almost propositions her, but a Susie thought makes him change his mind.
Once Jack gets home, he is in such a foul mood that he takes it out on Nina. She runs out of his apartment up to the roof, where Jack finds her. He apologizes and also offers to teach her something else to play besides ""Jingle Bells.""
After a few days, Jack goes to see Frank at his home to tell him he isn't coming back to the duo. He says he can't play the same songs the same way every night anymore. They open the bottle of booze they had received at the first professional engagement and drink. Then at the two pianos they started on many years before, for old times sake, they play and sing ""You're Sixteen.""
The film's final scene shows Jack waiting outside Susie's apartment. She's progressed from cat food jingles to vegetables. They both apologize for the way they acted when she left the act. She asks if they found a new girl singer. He says they didn't look for one. As she leaves to record a new jingle, he asks, ""Am I going to see you again?"" Not giving in easily, she asks, ""What do you think?"" He answers, ""Yeah, I think Im gonna see you again."" Then, after a pause, he says, ""Intuition."" As she walks away down the street ""My Funny Valentine"" is sung by Susie (or Michelle Pfeiffer) over the final credits."

"Charlie Cox is a divorced writer who lives in Los Angeles. Charlie and his daughter Joleen are on their way home from a cross country vacation when they run out of gas in Banco, Nevada; a small town located in a remote part of the desert. It's one day before Jolene's 14th birthday. Charlie and Joleen check a nearby gas station owned by a Vietnam war veteran named Duckett, but Duckett doesn't have any gas, so they head to the local supermarket to find a phone. Sheriff Bill Childers is in the store and he advises them to go to the trailer park to ask for gas. Joleen spots the body of the store's owner, Ferrell Hogus, in a pool of blood. The Sheriff states that the murderer is most likely a drifter. The man and daughter check into the nearby Palomino Guest Ranch and Trailer Park, which is owned by a hostile woman named Agnes Reed. Whilst her father uses the phone, Joleen speaks to Agnes's rebellious teenage son, Jimmy Reed, who she briefly came into contact with earlier at the gas station. A chemistry between the two teenagers is implied. Joleen later meets a sandy-haired boy named Pinky Sears, who is sent away by an angry Jimmy. That night, while Agnes is taking a bath after an argument with Jimmy, she is killed when a hand reaches in through her bathroom window and pushes a small fan into the bathtub water, electrocuting her. Charlie and Joleen also meet their neighbors, fellow travelers Louise and Amy.

"In real life, Robert Oppenheimer was the scientific head of the Manhattan Project, the secret wartime project in New Mexico where the first atomic bombs were designed and built. General Leslie Groves was in overall command of it. This film reenacts the project with an emphasis on their relationship."
"""If you build it, he will come,"" is what thirty-six-year-old novice farmer Ray Kinsella hears several times over the course of days from a bodiless voice emanating from somewhere in the cornfield on his Iowa farm. Later, he has a vision that the ""it"" is a baseball field, the ""he"" is Shoeless Joe Jackson, who was infamous for his association in the Chicago 8, the eight players of the 1919 White Series who were banned for life from the sport for throwing games in exchange for money from gamblers. Although it was proved that Jackson did take money, it was never proved that he participated in throwing any of the games. Ray grew up with baseball, his long-deceased father, John, who played in the minor leagues, lived in Chicago during that infamous year, and told stories to Ray about it and Jackson when he was growing up. He was estranged from his father at the time of his death, something that he now regrets. With the moral support of his wife, Annie, he tears up part of their cornfield to build that baseball field. He eventually hears the voice telling him other things, always without a clear understanding on his part of what it all means. One he believes it has to do with is famed '60's writer Terence Mann, now a recluse who stopped writing because he, renowned as the voice of his generation, didn't always want to be the answer to his generation's problems. Another he believes has to do with it is Archie ""Moonlight"" Graham, who played only one half of one inning of one major league game in 1922 and died in 1972. Ray's voice led path may be difficult to achieve since cynical Mann may not have the same direction of the voice as him and Graham is dead. He will have to work through these puzzles to understand the full meaning of what the voice wants for him, which may not happen if he and Annie lose the farm and thus the baseball field, a real possibility due to the latter taking away from earning income from the farm, especially as Annie's cutthroat brother, Mark, who says he is looking out for her best interest, will do whatever needed to get Ray back to what he considers reality of earning a living from the farm."

Powwow Highway is a Native American cult classic. ""For the Northern Cheyenne tribe of Lame Deer, Montana, the American Dream has taken a grim detour. Here, Buddy Redbow is a committed activist battling a suspicious land-grab. Philbert Bono is a serene spiritual warrior guided by sacred visions. But when Buddy's estranged sister, Bonny Redbow, is framed and jailed in New Mexico, the two men take Philbert's rust-wrecked '64 Buick 'war pony' on a road trip that makes some very unexpected stops along the way.""
It's a realistic, sometimes surrealistic view of the times for not only the Northern Cheyenne, but for most tribes in America. From third world living conditions to ill treatment by authorities and the general public. Against this background is the story of two Cheyenne men on very different paths, one spiritual, one materialistic, who end up on a road to save one of their own from wrongful imprisonment. Along the way they come to a greater understanding of each other and themselves, to heal old wounds and renew faith in their past as well as their future."
"8-year-old Jessica Riggs is raised by her older brother, Steve, and widowed father, John. Their apple farm has fallen on hard times. John is temporarily being helped by his sister-in-law, Sarah.
While walking home after a school Christmas pageant, Jessica witnesses a plastic reindeer fall from a Christmas decoration being hung above the main street in town. She concludes that it was Prancer from the order given in the poem ""A Visit from St. Nicholas"" (a.k.a. ""The Night Before Christmas"").
Afraid he will be unable to provide for Jessica, John discusses a plan for Sarah to take her in to raise temporarily. She overhears this, but initially does not know the full details. She and her best friend, Carol, go sledding and knock down some flowers at a house owned by a reclusive widow, Mrs. McFarland. While walking home, Jessica encounters a live reindeer in the woods. It runs away, disappearing into the darkness. Later, while walking home from school, she finds reindeer tracks and follows them into the woods once more. She hears a gunshot, and continues to walk. John eventually finds her, but almost hits the reindeer who is now standing in the road. Noticing it is wounded, he grabs his rifle, intending to shoot it. As Jessica pleads for him not to do so, it disappears.
Later while dreaming of Prancer, Jessica is startled awake by the scene of the plastic reindeer falling from earlier. She hears a noise and sees the window to the barn outside is open. Investigating, she finds the reindeer is now inside among the other animals. Afraid John will find him, she moves him to a shed. Certain that he is the ""real"" Prancer, she takes it upon herself to nurse him back to health. She calls a veterinarian who initially refuses, but comes over to find him.
Jessica later tells a mall Santa that she has Prancer, and gives him a Polaroid picture along with a letter to give to the real Santa before Christmas Eve. He takes them to the editor of the local newspaper. Eventually, Jessica apologizes to Mrs. McFarland, and asks her if she can have a job to help pay for oats for the reindeer. Mrs. McFarland agrees to pay her if she cleans a room in the house, and they become friends. The newspaper editor, inspired by Jessica's faith, writes an article which is then read by the local pastor in the middle of his sermon, which makes Jessica find out that she has been outed to the entire town. She becomes mad at Carol, who she thinks squealed. She then terminates her friendship with Carol, and later finds the article in the paper.
John, meanwhile, is reading the paper. Before he finds the article, he discovers Prancer has let all the other animals out of the barn. While he tries to round them up, Prancer goes inside the house and wrecks it. Townspeople begin to converge on the farm, wanting to see him. John grabs his rifle, threatening to shoot him when a local butcher stops him, offering to buy Prancer. Jessica, afraid the butcher will kill him, runs away in the night determined to rescue him. The butcher keeps him as a sales tool for his Christmas tree lot. Steve runs after her, telling her that he loves her even though they fight. She attempts to open Prancer's cage but falls, injuring her head.
Jessica stays in her bedroom, becoming despondent. John goes to her and she asks him to read a passage from ""Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus"". He tells her that times may continue to be hard for a long time but while he could bear losing the farm, he will not lose her. He changes his mind about sending her away. He suggests they take Prancer to Antler Ridge, which would be the perfect place for Santa to pick him up. The townspeople gather outside her window and begin singing to cheer her up. Prancer is taken to Antler Ridge where he runs out of sight. Following his tracks, John and Jessica notice that they vanish at the edge of a cliff. The faint sound of sleigh bells can be heard, and a streak of light is seen rising to meet Santa's sleigh. Jessica bids Prancer farewell, and to always remember her. The sleigh flies across the full moon and over the town towards the Riggs farm-its very first stop."

Since no gun was found on the perpetrator's person or at the scene and none of the witnesses could corroborate Megan's story definitively that the perpetrator was indeed wielding a gun, she is suspended from active duty. She is quickly albeit temporarily reinstated to the position of homicide detective because the spent shell casing from the bullet used in a subsequent murder had her name carved on it. This murder ends up being only the first in a series. Working on the case with fellow homicide detective Nick Mann, Megan initially has no idea who in her life could be the murderer.

Marina has the emotional support of her family, especially her sister Lola who works as a production assistant on the film. Orphaned when he was three, Ricky has spent the better part of his life in a psychiatric facility in he somewhat feigning mental instability, not that he isn't truly without his psychiatric problems. He has learned a variety of trades while institutionalized, locksmithing his favorite as it has allowed him to escape from the facility time and time again, he however always returning in really having nowhere else to go in being all alone in the world, and as he has had an ongoing sexual relationship with the facility's female director. He made the decision to become ""sane"" to be released so that he could be with Marina with who he had a singular sexual encounter on one of his previous escapes. With Marina really not knowing who he is - she indeed doesn't remember him - he believes he has no other option but to kidnap her so that the two can spend time together long enough for her to fall in love with him, his goal for them to get married and start a family. In doing so, he does not want to hurt her but will do whatever required to subdue her if she puts up a fight. While certain issues, such as she suffering from a raging toothache, regular painkillers not doing much due to her junkie past, only add to the problems of her kidnap, let alone people like Máximo and Lola who would notice her missing and thus go looking for her, Marina may discover that there truly is a fine line between love and hate, especially as she may be as needy as him for real human connection."

"A comedy of life's temptations - lust, greed and power. The city in question is Sydney and the colour green signifies greed and envy in David Williamsons amusing satire on its film and publishing industries. The story centers around the Rogers family, loosely modelled on Williamson's own. They have recently moved from Melbourne to Sydney. Colin (John Hargreaves) is Australia's most successful screenwriter (like Williamson), but currently down on his luck. He doesn't want to make what he perceives as a ""movie of the week"" about Tony Sanzari an amusement park hijacking that is offered to him by his agent, Elaine Ross (Ruth Cracknell), but a story about the coastwatchers of World War II, because his uncle was one, and it was Australia's great contribution to the war. His wife, Kate (Robyn Nevin), is a book editor and wants to publish a novel by Aboriginal writer Kath Mitchell (Michelle Torres) titled Black Rage, but her publisher, Ian Wall (Nicholas Hammond), says ""Blacks don't sell books."" They have three children, Penny (Ella Scott), who has been frequenting a disco called Downmarket, Hannah, whose teachers say she is depressed, and Sam (Haydon Samuels), whom Colin fears Kate is encouraging to be gay.
Colin teams with a womanizing hack writer named Mike McCord (Chris Haywood) to work on Coastwatchers, who hates the idea, but wants his name on the film as co-writer because it's an instant status boost in the industry, even though he is primarily just typing dictation. When he hears of Kate's problem, he prank calls Ian Wall, accuses him of racism, and threatens that a group of militants will mob the publishing house if he doesn't publish Black Rage.
Coastwatchers proves a ratings disaster, so Mike latches onto Colin for another project, a rip-off of Miami Vice set in Australia and loaded with Australianisms. Malcolm Bennett (Dennis Miller), who usually finances Colin's productions, advises him to get back with Elaine because his project is ""shit"". ""So is Miami Vice,"" Colin responds. ""That's classy shit;"" Malcolm tells him, ""this is absolute shit."" The difference is that the writers of Miami Vice are writing at the best of their abilities, while the fact that Colin is writing below his level is painfully obvious. During this time, Colin becomes attracted to Mike's girlfriend, Helen Davey (Nicole Kidman), but ultimately draws the line in the friendship and avoids cheating on his wife.
Ultimately, Kath Mitchell is nominated for the Booker Prize, and Kate accompanies her and Ian Wall to the awards ceremony, though she does not win. Although Kate tells Colin that Ian looks like a ""garden gnome"" she admits that she was unfaithful. A disillusioned Colin returns to Elaine Ross and accepts the project she offered him. Elaine calls Sydney ""The Emerald city of Oz. Everyone comes here along their yellow brick roads looking for the answers to their problems and all they find are the demons within themselves.""..."

"In ""Landscape Suicide"" Benning continues his examination of Americana through the stories of two murderers. Ed Gein was a Wisconsin farmer and multiple murderer who taxidermied his victims in the 1950s. Bernadette Prott was a California teenager who stabbed a friend to death over an insult in 1984. Benning's distanced approach to such grisly material is as far removed as possible from sensationalism, however. Although the acts of murder are both bizarre and violent, Benning dwells on them only minimally, emphasizing instead the details of psychological motivation, which in both cases seem frighteningly mundane. Benning has created a script which is a masterpiece of understated colloquial writing, and the actors he employs to re-enact confessional testimony and incidents recounted in trial transcripts perform with a flatly convincing lack of affect reminiscent of Gary Gilmore. The two monologues are embedded in Benning's characteristic meditations of landscape: long shots of the Wisconsin farmlands, general stores, dirt roads and pick-up trucks, and the carefully tended lawns, swimming pools, sprawling bungalows and malls of the middle-class California suburb. These images are offered in the classically spare mise-en-scene which Benning has perfected in his work as a cinematic poet of the contemporary American environment. Here, in his most accessible film so far, the beautiful, open vistas are dense with the significance of the catastrophes they engendered"

"Two brothers from a conservative family. The older brother, Salah Abu Al-Azm (Yahya Al-Fakharani), succeeded in his academic and professional life, graduating from the Faculty of Science with a degree in Chemistry and working for a government company after obtaining his Ph.D. He leads a peaceful life with his wife (Raja - Nora) and their only son (Koki - Karim Abu Zeid), despite the difficult living conditions and his meager government salary that barely covers their monthly needs. However, he is content with what God has given him.
The younger brother, Jamal Abu Al-Azm (Mahmoud Abdel Aziz), on the other hand, falls into the trap of drugs and becomes addicted. The older brother is saddened by the younger brother's situation after finding him enslaved to drugs. He creates a mixture of henna, herbal ingredients, aromatic oils, and chemical scents that closely resemble cannabis in color, texture, material, and smell, but is completely free of drugs. He gives it to his brother, who deceives him and consumes it along with his friends, believing it to be genuine cannabis. The next day, the older brother surprises him by revealing that what he drank yesterday was not cannabis, but a drug-free herbal mixture. He tries to convince him that the high he experiences is merely an illusion created by the smoke and the noise of the gathering.
Jamal tries to exploit his brother's genius and convinces him that he will try to abstain from real drugs on the condition that his brother creates a large piece for him to distribute among his friends and gradually distance himself from real drugs. The older brother agrees and creates a large piece for this innocent purpose. However, Jamal takes advantage of the situation and sells this piece to drug dealers (Abdou Al-Karf and Mohy El-Din Abdel Mohsen) as genuine drugs. He knows from the first glance that it is not drugs, but he is impressed by the genius of its creator, especially since he will have no difficulty in turning it into drugs by grinding a quantity of hallucinogenic pills and mixing them with the innocent mixture made by Salah Abu Al-Azm. Afterward, Jamal persuades his brother Salah with difficulty to sell this ""precious"" piece, which supposedly protects people from the harms of drugs, as they believe they are consuming real drugs. In reality, it is a large quantity of distributing this mixture. He convinces Salah's wife that his extra income is due to his work in a company in the afternoon, while Jamal invests his money in recording a cassette tape containing vulgar lyrics and songs. Until Salah, the chemist, accidentally discovers that his mixture has been tampered with by adding hallucinogenic pills, and that its harmful effects are much worse than those of real cannabis. He refrains from producing more of his mixture and asks his brother Jamal to stop. At the same time, the major drug dealer asks Jamal to prepare a ton of the mixture after informing him that he knew the truth and that he was buying henna, not cannabis. Jamal goes to his brother Salah, demanding him to prepare the ton and guide him to the person who makes this magical formula. Unable to bear the torture, Jamal reveals his brother's address to them. They bring him and, after injecting him with drugs, imprison him. Salah, after that, becomes a helpless addict, creating whatever his brother wants, while Jamal, despite himself, turns away from singing and drugs after witnessing the degradation of himself and his brother. The roles are reversed, and the film returns to the starting point. Instead of saving his brother Salah from the harms of drugs, he becomes an addict against his will, while his brother Jamal refrains from addiction by his own will, not due to the insistence of his older brother, who has lost everything - his health, home, and job. The film is one of the strongest Egyptian films of the 1980s and is classified as one of the most important Egyptian films due to the brilliance of its writer, director, and cast."
