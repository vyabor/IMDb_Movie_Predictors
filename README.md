## This local webapp predicts genres and similar movies based on a given movie plot summary input
## Requires Python 3.12

1. Open a command prompt window and run the following: python -m pip install -r 'requirements.txt'
2. Navigate to the Movie-Pickler/src folder of your decade of choice and run main.py in a terminal window
3. Navigate to the Movie-Predictor folder for your decade and run app.py
4. Congrats! You're running a movie predictor webapp locally!

I had previously uploaded the websites to Google Cloud Platform, but it became too expensive to maintain.
