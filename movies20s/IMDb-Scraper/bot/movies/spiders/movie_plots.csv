"There is a theory that man is born with half a per mille too little, that alcohol in the blood opens the mind to the outside world, problems seem smaller, and creativity increases. We know it well: after the first glass of wine, the conversation lifts, the possibilities open up. Martin is a high-school teacher who feels old and tired. His students and their parents want him terminated to increase their average. Encouraged by the per mille theory, Martin and his three colleagues throw themselves into an experiment to maintain a constant alcohol impact in everyday life. If Churchill won World War II in a dense fog of spirits, what could the strong drops do for them and their students? The result is positive in the beginning. Martin's class is in a different way now, and the project is being promoted to a real academic study with the collection of results. Slowly but surely, the alcohol makes the four friends and their surroundings loosen up. The results are rising, and they really begin to feel life. As the objects go inboard, the experiment progresses for some and goes off track for others. It becomes clearer and clearer that alcohol can generate great results in world history, but that all daring can also have consequences. The film is described as a fun, touching and thought-provoking drama about friendship, freedom--and alcohol."

The gentle-mannered George is quickly taken with Rose, while the volatile Phil, much influenced by his late mentor ""Bronco"" Henry, mocks Rose's son Peter for his lisp and effeminate manner. George and Rose soon marry. Rose uses George's money to send her son to college to study medicine and surgery, while she moves into the Burbank ranch house. Phil immediately takes a dislike to her, believing she took advantage of George for his wealth. His rough ways and taunting manner unnerve her. George organizes a dinner party with his parents and the governor so they can meet Rose and hear her play their new piano. Phil, after being asked by George to wash up before dinner, is nowhere to be found. Rose is very reluctant to play the piano, citing her lack of ability, but is pressured to do so by George and their guests. She is unable to play more than a few notes and is further humiliated when Phil, still dirty, enters and mentions all her practicing. As they leave, she takes a drink of alcohol, something she was previously opposed to. By the time Peter comes to stay at the ranch for the summer break, Rose has become an alcoholic, which she hides from George. Phil and his men taunt Peter, and he sequesters himself in his room, dissecting animals and studying diseases. In a secluded glade, Phil lies on the ground with Bronco Henry's handkerchief, draping it over his face. Peter enters the glade and finds a stash of magazines with Bronco Henry's name on them depicting nude men. He observes Phil bathing in a pond with the kerchief around his neck; Phil notices him and chases him off. Phil suddenly begins to show decency to Peter, offering to plait him a lasso from rawhide and teach him how to ride a horse. Phil is impressed when Peter immediately picks out a shadow in the shape of a dog on a nearby mountain. Peter, out on a solo ride, comes across a diseased cattle carcass and cuts into its hide with a scalpel. Out on a fencing job, Peter and Phil corner and kill a rabbit, and Phil gets an open wound on his hand. Afterwards, Peter tells Phil about finding the body of his father, who had hanged himself. Seeing how much time her son is spending with Phil, Rose's alcoholism worsens. Upon learning about Phil's policy of burning the hides he does not need for himself, Rose defiantly gives them to local Indigenous traders who thank her with a pair of gloves. She then collapses from her rapid alcohol consumption and George tends to her. With no hides to finish Peter's lasso, Phil is despondent until Peter offers him the hide he cut from the dead cattle. They spend the night in the barn finishing it, and Phil tells Peter a story of how Bronco Henry saved his life by combining their body heat in freezing weather and does not answer when Peter asks if they were naked and they then seductively share a cigarette. When Phil does not show up for breakfast the next morning, George finds him sickened in bed and his wound heavily infected. A delirious Phil looks for Peter to give him the finished lasso but George takes him away to the hospital before he can hand it over. In the next scene, George is seen picking out a coffin while Phil's body is prepared for burial. At his funeral, a doctor tells George that Phil most likely died from anthrax, puzzling him, as Phil was always careful to avoid diseased cattle. Having not gone to the funeral, Peter opens a Book of Common Prayer to the burial rite and then flips to the Psalter and reads Psalm 22:20: ""Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog."" He puts his finished lasso under his bed with gloved hands and watches George and a now sober Rose embrace, smiling, implying he intentionally gave Phil the diseased hide to save her life."

"Feminist film theorists have been exploring the ""male gaze"" and its various nuances and implications for decades. The term was first used in 1975 by Laura Mulvey-- who is also a key interviewee in BRAINWASHED. Almost 50 years later, we're still wrestling with the issue. With #malegaze on TikTok hitting 300 million views (and climbing), Lena Wilson, Playlist and Tiktok film reviewer wrote, ""You may think that on-screen sexism is a thing of the past, or that it can't possibly affect our society... Menkes is here to tell you, emphatically, that you are wrong.""
~~~~
BRAINWASHED builds on the vital work of Mulvey and other essential feminist writers including Judith Butler, bell hooks and Angela Carter. Integrating interviews with 21 remarkable women/nonbinary experts (plus one man!) and almost 200 canonical film clips from 1896 through the present, independent filmmaker Nina Menkes exposes, in precise detail, how shot design itself (POV, framing, camera movement, lighting, and even sound) has perpetuated the sexist binary throughout cinematic history. BRAINWASHED then connects these gendered ""laws"" of visual language to the twin epidemics of sexual harassment/assault, as well as employment discrimination against women."

"Mank captures the life of Mankiewicz between essentially 1933 and 1940, when America
was in the midst of the Depression and watching uneasily, but from far, the gathering
clouds of World War II. There is another presence that Fincher does well to focus on
in his telling of the making of Citizen Kane, the candidacy of Left-leaning Upton Sinclair
for the governorship of California, which sees the tinsel town gang up against him. As
Sinclair is portrayed as promoting ""anti-American"" values, with MGM lending its might
to a campaign that would now be described as fake news, Mank is forced to confront his
own compromises and little lies."

"It's the early 1980s. Married Korean-Americans Jacob and Monica Yi have moved their young family, which includes their two children Anne and David Yi, from urban California to rural Arkansas in pursuit of Jacob's dream to make a success of himself for the family. Like they did in California, Jacob and Monica will work in a factory separating baby chicks by sex for processing, in California making just enough money in such work for Jacob, as the oldest son, to send money home to his family in Korea, but also to make this move. That dream is the fifty acres of land he purchased to start a farm growing Korean vegetables for what he sees as the untapped and burgeoning market of the growing Korean-American population. But this move is not Monica's dream, especially living in the three-bedroom trailer propped on cinder blocks that is on the property as their home, the property itself which is undeveloped and largely unserviced in its isolation. One of Monica's major concerns is exactly that isolation in David having a heart defect and she wanting to be in a city to be closer to doctors and a hospital, especially important if something negative happens unexpectedly and quickly with David. That isolation also means that beyond anything she develops with people at the factory, Monica will have no social network. After some heated arguments, Jacob and Monica come to the compromise that they will stay for Jacob to try and make a go of a farm, and that they will bring Monica's long widowed mother from Korea to act as a caregiver for the children while they're at work. Grandmother's arrival into the already cramped trailer adds its own complications in the family dynamic as David has never met his maternal grandmother, who is not what he envisions an American grandmother should be."

"Alisha (Deepika Padukone), a yoga instructor, believes that her personal and professional lives are in shambles. She's having trouble finding an investor for her fitness software, and her six-year relationship with Karan, a struggling writer, has reached a stalemate.
Just when she thinks she's had enough of her boring life, her filthy rich cousin (Ananya Panday) and her hot-shot fiancee Zain show up (Siddhant Chaturvedi). Within a short period of time, Alisha and Zain become oddly attracted to each other and embark on a passionate love affair, keeping their respective partners in the dark. During their romantic encounters and passionate love-making sessions, the two bond over their traumatic past, blissfully unaware of the impending storm.
An early moment in Gehraiyaan, which lasts only a few seconds, embodies the film's entire core. Alisha (Deepika Padukone), the film's protagonist, is viewing an old home movie. It's a scenario from a family vacation, and she recognizes something: her pre-teen self trying to put on a sweater, which gets trapped around her neck and covers her head. Alisha can't see or breathe, and she says she's ""suffocating"" to her mother. That sense of being trapped and suffocated, which dates back to her youth, has followed her throughout her life.
Her mother used to describe the same sensation; when the anguish grew overwhelming, she hung herself from the ceiling fan (further suffocated herself). Alisha, like many other children of unhappy parents, fears that she, too, would become like them, that she, too, will be unable to escape their past. It's even more difficult for her because she is constantly reminded of her history. She had known Karan (Dhairya Karwa) and Tia while growing up in Mumbai for a few years (Ananya Pandey). For the past six years, Karan, a former ad writer currently working on a book (noob move), has been dating and living with Alisha. He is oblivious and inattentive because he is engrossed in his own world. Alisha, a yoga instructor, has been having trouble raising money for her mobile app. She avoids her father since she holds him responsible for her mother's death. She feels ""suffocated"" since the sweater has adhered to her again.
However, she rekindles her friendship with Tia, and the childhood trio takes a break. There's a new member this time: her fiancee, Zain (Siddhant Chaturvedi). After some time, Alisha realizes that Zain, who has his own scars from the past, isn't all that different from her. He, like Alisha, was unable to save his mother. He isn't from a well-adjusted family, unlike Tia and Karan, and he isn't 'normal.' Zain is a warm blazing bulb in a sea of flickering and chilly tube lights: someone who has been there, someone who understands. They converse, drink, and tell stories. They flirt, joke, and hook up. The sweater is finally loosening up. Alisha can finally take a breath.
This wonderful mix of awareness and perplexity makes perfect sense, because it highlights the film's most striking layer: Alisha is living a lie because she is intent on finding and moulding her story. The climax was surprising because we saw Zain, who Alisha had come to see as her anchor, change into someone who wanted to kill her because she had become an obstacle in his life. When Alisha discovers Zain's texts and notices him slipping tablets to her drink, she understands he's been lying to her yet again. In the ensuing brawl, Zain takes a knock to the head and falls off the yacht, killing himself. That's when Alisha returns to the mainland on her own.
""Gehraiyaan"" gets it right when it comes to how trauma may be passed down through generations and how, without correct guidance, we end up repeating the mistakes we are trying to avoid. Alisha began the affair to get out of a dead-end relationship in which she was trapped because she didn't want to be like her mother. However, when the truth was revealed, she realized she had made the same errors. She decides to accept her past and move on from it rather than resisting it in a very vulnerable chat with her father. This reminds us of something we've heard before: you can't get rid of your luggage; you can only learn to carry it in such a way that it doesn't seem as heavy over time.
Another part of the conclusion is if Zain was aware of Alisha and Tia's reality and if this knowledge influenced any of his actions. We can only assume that even if he was aware, he did nothing about it because the entire property was obviously in Tia's name. The real kicker, though, comes in the final few seconds of the film. As Alisha makes the decision to put the past behind her, a phantom of it appears in front of her. The old woman who confronted Alisha in the end was someone Alisha and Zain had aided during one of their rendezvous on the yacht while they were still together.
At the engagement party, Alisha runs into the old woman, who recognizes her and addresses her by her name. ""Gehraiyaan"" comes to an end here, and it's up to the audience to figure out what transpired. Is Alisha manage to redirect the topic and resolve it in time, or does the old woman explain to Tia how she knows Alisha and Zain? Is everything Alisha tries to put behind her about to resurface and cling to her even more tightly than before? Is it a hint that you'll never completely be able to let go of your past-messy relics will always find their way back into your life? That's the one part where we welcome the viewer's imagination being used."

She further discusses how that view of herself led to a Catch-22 in relationships, getting into them in her own negative view of herself, and they in turn exacerbating that view.

"Still relatively young Jeff Jackson is forced to retire as a Boston PD detective due to an injury sustained while working a case that killed his partner, the injury-causing bullet, still lodged in his back, too close to the spinal cord to remove and which causes him occasional physical pain. With his father having recently passed, Jeff has settled on Martha's Vineyard in his father's house, the island where Jeff spent much time in the summers growing up. Jeff's relaxed life of fishing and working on his father's boat takes a turn when he discovers the murdered dead body of a young man, Ray Norris, he had seen around the marina the preceding day. With Martha's Vineyard Police Chief Madieras, his father's best friend, having little history working on murder investigations, Jeff, initially reluctant, eventually accepts the offer to consult on the case. Also working on the case is the Chief's daughter, Dr. Zee Madieras, Jeff's childhood friend and now the acting M.E. Ray, who was not local to the island, still seemed to have ties there, one of those that could have led to his murder. One of those ties seems to be a local foundation, Harriet's Hope, the Executive Director Payton Bartel and two of the more prominent Board members, married Helena and Thomas Percy, the faces of the just held gala fundraiser for the foundation where Ray had been present. Also attached to the charity is accountant Gerald Martin, whose two offspring, Bradley and Stacy Martin, had been seen with Ray. The issue with Gerald in particular is that the IRS is investigating the charity for possible fraud in money being skimmed from their coffers, Gerald's firm which handles the books. Also on Jeff and Zee's radar is Donovan Fletcher, the owner of the boat which Ray had used, Fletcher who Jeff knows has criminal ties in Boston.

Bugs and her allies enter the Matrix to help locate Neo's body in the real world, and discover that Smith is Agent Smith, having been keeping close watch over Anderson's activities. Bugs helps Anderson to elude Smith and his new ability to take control over numerous individuals within the Matrix as a swarm.

"One night at the Edelvine Academy for Girls, a clique of girls led by ruthless popular girl Alice, play a prank on their classmate Kerrie by faking a haunting by the Edelvine Ghost, an urban legend involving a student who killed herself. Upset, Kerrie goes back to her dorm room where she glimpses a figure watching her. When the girls hear her screams and rush into her room, they discover Kerrie dead, having fallen out of her dorm room window.
New student Camille Meadows takes Kerrie's place at the academy. She meets headmistress Mrs. Landry and her son Trevor who works as a handyman. Student Helina shows Camille to her room which happens to be Kerrie's old room. Camille notices strange supernatural occurrences in the dorm room.

He lives out of two small suitcases and stays in motels, where he removes any decor and covers all the furniture in plain sheets secured with twine.
At a casino, Tell encounters La Linda, an acquaintance from the gambling world. She runs a stable, a group of investors who back gamblers for a portion of their winnings. She offers to stake William but he refuses, unwilling to be burdened by the responsibility.
In Atlantic City, a security-industry convention is being held in the same building as the casino. Tell slips into a seminar held by retired Major John Gordo, but decides to leave almost immediately. On the way out, he is recognized and confronted by a young man, Cirk Baufort, who slips him his name and number. After a nightmare about torture in a prison camp, Tell calls the young man and agrees to meet. Cirk informs Tell he knows who he really is: PFC William Tillich, a soldier who was tried and convicted for his role in the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. Cirk explains that his father, Roger Baufort, was also at Abu Ghraib; like Tell, he was dishonorably discharged and served time, but the experience led him to drug addiction and made him violently abusive. Cirk's mother left the family, and Roger eventually killed himself. Gordo was the superior of Tillich and the elder Baufort and trained them in enhanced interrogation techniques, but as he was involved as a ""civilian consultant"" avoided facing any charges or culpability. Cirk holds Gordo responsible for what happened to his family and is planning to capture, torture, and kill him for revenge and seeks Tell's help. Tell refuses but offers to take Cirk along as he gambles in an attempt to help the young man avoid a violent life.
At their next stop, Tell informs La Linda that he is interested in making an arrangement. He reveals to her his desire to go on the World Series of Poker tour in order to win enough money to help Cirk cover his debts and start a new life, after which Tell will retire. After early WSOP matches, Tell makes money but loses to Mr. USA, an obnoxious Ukrainian player who has taken on a jingoistic American persona. He bonds with Cirk and feels a growing attraction to La Linda, but avoids getting too close as he continues making money gambling.
At a qualifying round in Panama City, Cirk shares that he still plans to kill Gordo. Tell takes Cirk back to his motel, confronting the younger man with a harsh interrogator persona. He presents Cirk with $150,000 from his gambling winnings, enough for Cirk to pay off his and his mother's debts and return to college. He insists Cirk return to his mother in Oregon and forget about Gordo, threatening violence if he does not comply; Cirk leaves with the money. Tell, who has begun a relationship with La Linda, advances to the final table of the WSOP. While on a break he receives a message from Cirk, revealing that rather than returning home he went to Gordo's house to kill him. Tell is unsettled and, distracted during the resumed match, abruptly walks off the casino floor. A news report shows that Gordo had killed an armed home intruder - Cirk.
Tell drives through the night to get to Gordo's house, covering the furniture as he does in his motel rooms. Gordo returns home and Tell holds him at gunpoint, revealing who he is and why he is there. Rather than shooting him, Tell takes Gordo into another room for a ""dramatic reenactment"" of their time in Abu Gharib. Both men are heard screaming in agony, and eventually Tell emerges from the room severely wounded. He calls the police to report a homicide.
Tell is incarcerated in the same military prison as before, accepting the routine and ascetic setting as he feels it is what he deserves. La Linda arrives for a visit and the two reach out to each other, each placing a single finger on the glass separating them."

"In 1978, Patrizia Reggiani is a young, attractive Italian woman working as an office manager within her father's small trucking firm. At a party, Patrizia meets Maurizio Gucci, a law student and heir to a 50% interest in the Gucci fashion house through his father Rodolfo. Patrizia aggressively pursues the awkward Maurizio, charming him into love. Rodolfo warns Maurizio that Patrizia is only after wealth and tells Maurizio that he will disinherit him if he marries Patrizia. Maurizio chooses Patrizia over his connection to Gucci, leaving the family. Patrizia and Maurizio marry, and Maurizio takes a job at the Reggiani trucking company. When Patrizia becomes pregnant, she sees her child as an avenue for familial reconciliation. She lets it slip to Maurizio's uncle Aldo that she is pregnant; Aldo is delighted by the news and takes the couple under his wing. Aldo introduces Patrizia to his unintelligent son Paolo, who aspires to be a designer within Gucci despite his lack of talent. Thanks to Aldo, Maurizio and a terminally ill Rodolfo reconcile shortly before the latter's death. Rodolfo writes Maurizio back into his will, but fails to sign a document transferring the Gucci shares to him before he dies. Patrizia fakes Rodolfo's signature, giving Maurizio a 50% interest in Gucci. Patrizia starts to devise a plot to obtain a controlling interest in Gucci by acquiring some of Aldo and Paolo's shares (the two hold the other 50% interest). She clashes with Aldo over the firm's clandestine sale of cheap ""fake"" Gucci products on the black market, and begins to consult Giuseppina, a psychic, for guidance. She manipulates Maurizio, who has little real interest in Gucci, into taking a more active role within the company. Paolo acquires proof that Aldo has been evading taxes in the United States; he gives the proof to Patrizia in exchange for her promise that he will be allowed to design his own line. Aldo is arrested by the IRS and sentenced to a year and a day in prison. Patrizia lies to the Italian police and tells them that Paolo is not authorized to use the Gucci trademark; the police stop the fashion show by force. Patrizia and Maurizio ask Paolo to sell them his shares, but he rebuffs them and cuts ties between them. Italian police ransack Maurizio's house and attempt to arrest Maurizio for forging Rodolfo's signature. Maurizio and Patrizia flee to Switzerland, where Maurizio meets his old friend Paola Franchi. After an argument between Maurizio and Patrizia, Maurizio decides that he is tired of his wife's influence on himself and the company. He orders his wife and daughter to return to Italy and begins an affair with Paola. When Maurizio's business plans harm the company, he seeks assistance from equity company Investcorp, through which he hatches a scheme to acquire shares of the company from a now-impoverished Paolo. Aldo returns from prison and immediately realizes what Paolo has done. When Investcorp offers to buy Aldo out, he refuses until Maurizio reveals himself as the deal's instigator. Dejected, Aldo sells the shares and cuts contact with Maurizio. Patrizia attempts a reconciliation with Maurizio, but he flatly ignores her. Later, he asks Patrizia for a divorce through his long-time assistant Domenico De Sole, which Patrizia refuses. Maurizio recruits up-and-coming designer Tom Ford to revitalize the company's image through a new line. Ford's products are successful, but Maurizio has so thoroughly mismanaged the company that Investcorp's leaders feel compelled to buy him out, replacing him with Ford and De Sole. Patrizia eventually grows so furious with Maurizio that she asks Giuseppina to help her kill him. Giuseppina puts Patrizia in contact with some hitmen ""from Sicily."" A few days later, the hitmen shoot Maurizio to death in broad daylight outside his residence. Closing title cards to describe the fate of the remaining characters: Aldo dies of prostate cancer and Paolo died in poverty shortly following the sale of their shares to Maurizio. Patrizia, Giuseppina, and the hitmen are sentenced to long prison terms following their arrest for murder.

However, Raavie dies, reportedly due to natural causes. Soon after, though, Anshul is abducted by RAW, who reveal that one of the hijackers, Daljeet ""Doddy"" Singh (Zain Khan Durrani), had purposely withheld her inhaler, pusher her into the galley and thrown heavy blankets on her, increasing her suffering as she died.

After his training, which showcases his extraordinary memory and improves his previously sub-par psychical skills, he is assigned to the hijacking desk. In 1983, he finds one of the hijackers while visiting his brother in London and tracks them; he raids their house with other RAW agents and captures three of them but the fourth, Doddy Singh, escapes.

"Natalie Simmons is the driven host of a San Francisco-based lifestyle television show and likes to control as much of her persona as she can. That control gets her into trouble as a few weeks before Valentine's Day: she's fired, arguably as the ratings have declined because she's no longer being authentic--thus, no longer connecting with her audience. Only telling her parents Alicia and Aaron Simmons, Natalie heads to her small hometown just outside of Portland to regroup, and to help with the town's annual Valentine's Day Festival co-chaired by Alicia. The trip is despite her boyfriend of two years, the show's director Brooks, needing to stay in San Francisco over Valentine's Day. Natalie has never gone back home since high school, solely to avoid her high-school sweetheart, artist Zach Williams, after their less-than-smooth breakup when he went to Europe to pursue his art degree and wouldn't allow her to follow him instead of taking her first job in San Francisco. Natalie knows that Alicia is still friends with Zach's mother Sue Williams, the other co-chair; what she doesn't know is that Zach no longer works as a professional artist after buying the local hardware store, and that Alicia and Sue have always thought that Natalie and Zach were perfect for each other and that they're now planning to do whatever they can to reunite them. At least they can make them spend time together in manipulating the two to organize the festival's auction, which funds the following year's festival. Natalie and Zach's time together is filled with the tension of not wanting to dwell on their painful past, but it makes Natalie reevaluate her life, including her relationship with Brooks. What may ultimately affect Natalie and Zach's relationship is whether she ever learns the truth about why he didn't want her to follow him to Europe."

"It's the Christmas season. Working for Aspire Magazine, long widowed Rebecca McBride has written an article about a Christmas memory from her childhood in the town of Pine River. In the center of town, what was called the Angel Tree would mysteriously be set-up and decorated. People would write down their Christmas wishes and hang those notes on the tree, with many of the even most unlikely of wishes being granted by that unknown town benefactor who has become known as ""The Angel"". When she lived in Pine River, Rebecca believed in the tree as witnessed by the wish of her childhood best friend, Matthew Anderson, being granted, that his family's struggling diner be saved against the odds. Rebecca does confide to her editor Nina that her own belief in the tree faded that year despite Matthew's wish being granted, as her own, to live in Pine River forever, was not, with her family moving shortly thereafter because of her father's job. Regardless, Nina wants Rebecca to write a follow-up article for the Christmas edition, namely to discover the identity of the Angel, with a regular column which would allow Rebecca to choose her own stories on the line. This story requires Rebecca to return to Pine River for the first time in twenty years, she with her adolescent daughter Cassie in tow. Rebecca does return to find the tradition of the tree has continued, now for forty years. She also finds that Matthew is still at the family diner, he who took over the business when his father passed.

In the process, Rebecca may come to an understanding about why she is so determined to discover the identity of the Angel beyond the professional benefit to her, and holistically what the mystery of the Angel Tree means to her and to the town."

"Deep in the forests of Northern Italy resides the prized white Alba truffle. Desired by the wealthiest patrons in the world, it remains a pungent but rarified mystery. It cannot be cultivated or found, even by the most resourceful of modern excavators. The only souls on Earth who know how to dig it up are a tiny circle of canines and their silver-haired human companions-Italian elders with walking sticks and devilish senses of humor-who only scour for the truffle at night so as not to leave any clues for others. Still, this small enclave of hunters induces a feverish buying market that spans the globe. With unprecedented access to the elusive truffle hunters, filmmakers Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw (The Last Race, 2018 Sundance Film Festival) follow this maddening cycle from the forest floor to the pristine restaurant plate. With a wily and absurdist flare, The Truffle Hunters captures a precarious ritual constantly threatened by greed and outside influences but still somehow protected by those clever, tight-lipped few who know how to unearth the magic within nature."

"Mandy Page (Nicola Posener) loves Christmas and is proud of her hobby and craft store that holds classes, hosts parties and private events. As Mandy sifts through a box of donated items and flips through the pages of a classic book, THE CHRISTMAS CAROL, a coin drops out of an envelope addressed to Santa. It's a little girl's request for Santa to please give the coin to her father who died in the war, ""he would love it."" The letter is dated Dec 11, 1947. ""Judith...who are you,"" she wonders.
Mandy is determined to find Judith and return the coin. In the same box is a hymn book from the Creek Hill Chapel. She drives to the Chapel and meets Jonah (Brad Johnson) who is there renovating and is the one who donated the books he found in a back room. When Mandy explains her mission, Jonah likes what he sees and the instant chemistry between them prompts him to offer his help in finding the now 70-year-old woman whose name is Judith. Jonah asks the pastor (Paul D. Hunt) of the chapel, but he is not familiar with a woman named Judith and old church records were ruined several years ago when a pipe burst. Mandy goes to the antique book store around the corner to have the coin appraised. She learns it is a proof coin that could be worth as much as $30,000.
Jonah volunteers to help find Judith. Their search begins at the Everett Town Hall where they hope to find a list of soldiers from the area who served in World War II. While this results in volumes of data, they stumble across the name ""Victor Franklin"" listed in the back of the book. Jonah searches the local online property records and discovers and address and phone number of a 78-year-old man. Failing to reach him on the phone, Jonah and Mandy meet at his address.

After hours at the craft store, Jonah and Mandy create ugly Christmas sweaters and discuss the Dear Santa letters they wrote as kids.

Jonah gets a call to finish a job for which he has no workmen., Mandy helps him out by doing some painting at the project.

She goes to the pastor of the chapel to ask for a favor.
Back at the store, many tips over a box she placed the coin in and discovers it is missing. She blatantly accuses Jonah of stealing it to pay his bills. He stares at her in utter disbelief, turns and walks away, taking with him any chance for a happy life together or helping to find Judith. Mandy realizes she hasn't returned the yearbooks as promised. She goes to Jonah's house to collect them Jonah leaves Mandy standing at the door tell her he will return the yearbooks he has himself.

She calls Jonah to meet at the coffee shop. Mandy apologizes and Jonah gives her an envelop with copies of the yearbook photo of Victor Franklin and his cousin Judith Lewis.

"hijacked the phrase to describe anything said negatively about him), is discussed, specifically from 2015 to present day, and especially within an American political context. Such disinformation has become more easily spread with technology where almost anybody with a computer, Internet access, and know how can have a platform, more often than not without oversight. The disinformation is usually borne out of a sense of opposition usually by the alt right, and knowledge that what is being perpetrated is indeed not the truth. Methods to spread the disinformation, especially through social media platforms as a start which often then move to specific cable news outlets who ""purport"" to tell the truth, are discussed, especially in that most of these platforms were designed by their largely young, white, male creators without the aforementioned want for oversight, that is until such disinformation touches them profoundly and personally which is rarely the case.

"How much do you *really* know about how Christianity got started? Whether you are a Christian, atheist, or member of another faith, it's impossible to ignore the impact that Christianity has had on Western civilization. But most people, including many Christians, don't have a solid grasp of the history of early Christianity - even though it's hinted at in the New Testament. Many people still think the gospels were written by the people whose names adorn the books. Many people still think those people were eyewitnesses of Jesus. Many people don't realize how much Paul of Tarsus reinvented early Christianity to suit his own vision, and how much tension he created with the original disciples. Over the last century, New Testament scholars have examined the text word by word to tease apart the true history from accepted tradition. In this light-heated but factual film, we tell the ""true"" story of early Christianity with the help of twelve biblical scholars, Renaissance masterpieces and humorous animation. It's neither a film about faith nor a film attacking or making fun of Christianity. It's an honest attempt to piece together a very complex and fascinating story that everyone will enjoy."

"Tiffany hosts and her friend Liz produces Renovation Project, the Home Design Channel's platinum standard - in every respect - television show, which is all about presenting restrained elegance, including of Tiffany, as shown by their high end sponsors. The show was originally produced by Tiffany's former boyfriend Haiden, who discovered her, the two who drifted apart as their careers progressed, Tiffany at the time working on perfecting her on-screen image. With increasing competition eating into the show's ratings including from Haiden's newly produced show Flip It Up also on the channel, Kimberly, one of the network executives, without telling Tiffany or Liz beforehand, brings back Haiden to co-produce, he to help usher in a repurposed show which in its current form may now be seen as repressed rather than restrained: instead of just a renovation of a house, the show would be a ""renovation"" of the homeowner as well, a complete lifestyle makeover if you will. Kimberly also demands that the first subject be Brooks, the last minute replacement carpenter for what was the last taped show in the old format. Kimberly liked the butting of heads between Brooks and Tiffany from unused footage that she saw, has already focus group tested Brooks, whose numbers were high, and that he seems like the type of person who needs a makeover in outwardly looking like he doesn't care about how he presents himself. Tiffany needing to dangle a carrot in front of him, Brooks is a reluctant participant in not believing he needing a makeover, which in turns leads to on camera torment purposefully by Brooks toward Tiffany in she tormenting him purely by being the boss of the process. Once they let their guard down and discover more about the other including why Brooks' house with the good foundation largely sits empty, Tiffany and Brooks seem to be teetering on the verge of romantic feelings for the other. What may prevent them from taking that leap on the personal side are Haiden's admission to her that he returned to the show largely in wanting to get back together, and if Tiffany makes a major decision with the renovation/makeover that hurts Brooks in favor of good television, a strong possibility as she learns this show with Brooks will be the deciding factor whether Renovation Project: Lifestyles or Flip It Up will be the sole survivor into HDC's new season."

Her boss/sister, Reagan (Autumn Federici), wants her to go to Solvang, the USA's most Christmassy town for their websites next holiday vlog piece. Reagan books her a room and sends her out to the town.
Inn owner Laurel (Kellie Jakie), is worried about reservations being down for the holidays and gets ready for the season with her husband Hayden (Mark Hapka). Hayden and his friend Sawyer Larsen (Jon Prescott) bring a Christmas tree into the inn to begin the decorations. They town is excited about the anomaly of snow they received the prior night.
When Aubrey arrives in town, she believes the town is a kitschy tourist trap. She is almost run over by a handsome stranger named Sawyer driving a surrey cycle. She takes pictures of the town and watches the Christmas tree lighting. Then Aubrey heads to the Dolphin Bed and Breakfast Inn.
Hayden welcomes Aubrey with a warm hug like she is family and shows her to her room. Aubrey is impressed with the romantic personality of their inn. Hayden introduced Aubrey to Laurel. Then they pour her some wine and force Aubrey to decorate a Christmas tree with them. That night, Aubrey titles her first draft of her article ""Santa's Tourist Trap"", but is starting to reconsider her original attitude.
To get to know the town, Aubrey goes to the city commissioner Darren Larsen (Joe Lando), who hooks her up with his son Sawyer who is a community coordinator. Aubrey and Sawyer bicker because she wants the ""real"" story of Solvang. Sawyer argues the facades and wind mill are really part of the town's identity. He thinks Aubrey is shallow and superficial to really stop and enjoy the smell of the sweets, They bargain. In exchange for an autograph he can give as a Christmas present, as Aubrey is a famous songwriter, Sawyer agrees to give her the real tour.
The first stop is Estelle's (Jo Marie Payton) Christmas shop, Sawyer's godmother's store. Aubrey learns the legend of the nisse, gnomes that guard the farmlands but come out to play during the Christmas season. Aubrey buys some white storks. Back at the inn, Laurel provides Aubrey background on Sawyer as she prepares angel costumes for the town nativity scene. Aubrey reveals her broken engagement of the past. Laurel pegs her as a hopeless romantic. Meanwhile, Sawyer stops at his parent's home where cooking baking with his mom Miriam (Tracey E. Bregman) and sister Gibby (Lexi Giovagnoli) is in full swing.

The next morning, Aubrey and Sawyer the Mortensen's bakery, which is owned by Sawyer's mother Miriam where Aubrey sees the gingerbread village and samples Miriam's Christmas cookies. Aubrey notices the theater where the nativity pageant will take place. She is impressed with the low admission price that allows everyone to enjoy the Christmas story. Then they take in Ingeborg's chocolate store. Sawyer's sister Gibby is behind the counter. Sawyer reveals he is owner of the store and limits Aubrey's samples to three. As they chat, Aubrey and Sawyer decide they are both the creative sibling in their families. They decide to go to the Christmas Story pageant together. When Sawyer arrives at the inn, Aubrey looks fabulous and together with Laurel and Hayden, they enjoy the performance.
With pressure from her sister, Aubrey works furiously on her story for three days. She has changed her mind about the town being a tourist trap and is looking for a new hook for the piece. She decides to stay an extra weekend. Laurel teases her that it might be more about Sawyer than the story.
Sawyer invite Aubrey on a candlelight walking tour. They walk through the town with candles and talk about the Danish custom of storks nesting on the roof bringing good luck. The next day the four new friends participate in a Christmas parade. Then they head to Sawyer's chocolate shop for ice cream and then dance to one of Aubrey's Christmas songs. Hayden and Laurel sneak out. Sawyer and Aubrey talk about their dating lives and nearly kiss when the chocolates they are making start dropping off the conveyor belt.
Aubrey decides to stay in town even longer. She claims to still need to find an ending for her article. Her boss/sister is understanding and pushes Aubrey to follow the love. Aubrey has been writing songs and overhears Laurel singing and is inspired. She asks why Laurel doesn't sing, and Laurel shares that her father died in a car accident. He wanted to be a musician, but her mother thought it was not very sensible, so she dropped it. Aubrey encourages Laurel to be open to possibilities. Laurel offers the same advice to Aubrey when they discuss her blooming relationship with Sawyer.
Aubrey and Sawyer join the kids' scavenger hunt with special clues prepared by Sawyer parents. Their first clue takes them to Sawyer's parent home in search for the nisse. Just as they are about to kiss again, Gibby interrupts and insists that no nisse were hidden there as she has been around all day finishing a term paper. Aubrey and Sawyer head for the stores at the mall. They make their way to Estelle's Christmas shop. As they search the store, Estelle corners Aubrey and learns how Sawyer's and Aubrey's relationship has progressed. Once Estelle reads their scavenger hunt clue, she know immediately the nisse is hid at the bed and breakfast inn.
As the night chills, Sawyer has arranged a horse drawn trolley to take them back to the Dolphin Inn. On the way they make plans to see each other again after Aubrey leaves to spend Christmas with her sister in San Francisco. While they search the inn and find the nisse under the reindeer decoration, Aubrey's blog post is published. The title is Solvang: Santa's Tourist Trap. Laurel sees the post and feels so betrayed that she interrupts a Christmas kiss. In the article, Aubrey defames the town and insults Sawyer. Aubrey tries to explain it is a mix-up, and she sent the wrong draft to her sister. Aubrey has the blog taken off the web site and leaves embarrassed to sulk in Los Angeles.
Reagan arrives at Sawyer's place two days before Christmas upset that she didn't call and isn't coming to San Francisco for Christmas. Aubrey tells Reagan what a great guy Sawyer is and how real he was. Reagan vows to help Aubrey make things right again.
Aubrey posts a follow up blog post. She receives a package from Solvang from Laurel, apologizing for freaking out. It includes the storks. The town sees the new post and forgives Aubrey. Aubrey shows up in Solvang with a new track that she had a DJ make up for her. She brings the track for Laurel to perform her new Christmas song. Reagan and her family arrive in Solvang for the Christmas Eve festivities. Sawyer loves the new article and Aubrey. They finally kiss"

"On December 23, Lincoln Loud receives a package from the Snail Shipping postal service. Inside the package is a present he spent the whole year saving up to buy before he could give it to his entire family as a Christmas gift: a sled that can support thirteen people. Suddenly, his father calls everybody to come to eat breakfast. During breakfast, Rita, the mother of the family, receives a phone call from her oldest daughter, Lori. During the phone call, Lori tells everyone that she may not be able to come home for Christmas that year because she needs to study for her upcoming exams and prepare for an upcoming golf tournament. Not only that, but the Loud family's house is three hours away from her college, and she thinks it may be easier to spend Christmas with her boyfriend, Bobby, because he lives closer to campus. Soon after that, Luna reveals that her girlfriend, Sam, invited her to come skiing with her on Christmas Day, and Luan reveals that she has a comedy gig at the local senior center, Sunset Canyon Retirement Home. Everybody supports their plans for the holiday, except for Lincoln, because them being away would interfere with his plan to use the sled that he worked hard to buy all year, and he does not want his present for the family to go to waste immediately. He throws his mother's cell phone into a glass of orange juice, which prompts her to hold a family meeting. At the family meeting, the parents announce that they are taking the kids who do not have holiday plans with them on a vacation to Miami. Lincoln protests against the trip, as he will definitely not be able to use his sled in Miami, but he also justifies that his youngest sister, Lily, has been selected to light the Christmas tree at the mall on Christmas Eve. Although the parents understand the sources of Lincoln's conservative attitude, they encourage him to play along with them and make the most of the current situation. Lincoln then tries to appeal to his family one last time by revealing his present to them all, but since he has not handled the package with the sled inside cautiously, the sled is broken to pieces by the time he opens the package. Because the sled is broken to pieces, along with the fact that there has not been any snowfall recently, the parents make the final decision to take the entire family to Miami. Lincoln is devastated by this decision because he wants to preserve his family traditions, and he decides to bring everyone together for the holidays once and for all. He enlists help from his best friend, Clyde, who agrees to assist him in his scheme. They decide to start by making Lori homesick so she will come home for the holidays. Lincoln mails his father's figgy pudding to Lori's college, and when it arrives the next day, Lori becomes homesick because she has never missed her father's figgy pudding on Christmas once. She then decides to come home for the holidays, and after telling her boyfriend, Bobby, about her plan, he starts to drive her home on his moped. Next up, the boys take voice recordings from a rock star named Mick Swagger, then mix them up to present a fake message that he will be arriving in their town on Christmas Day. They then send the message to Luna, who falls for it and decides to attend Mick Swagger's ""concert"" on that day, knowing that it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Next up, they decide that they need to create some kind of threat that would scare the Loud parents into not wanting to go to Miami. They use Clyde's theater props and tandem bicycle to create a shark/crocodile hybrid called a ""Sharkodile"" that they deem to be so dangerous, nobody will be safe on land or in the water. They then steal a mannequin named Tanya from the mall to use as a victim in the staged attack they plan to film. Next up, they go to the senior center and dirty Luan's reputation until the board decides to fire her from her gig. With Lincoln's sisters who had plans taken care of, he and Clyde take their ""Sharkodile"" and mannequin to the lake, which they stage as Miami Beach, then film an alleged Sharkodile attack. They then send it to the local news reporter, Katherine Mulligan, who believes the footage to be real and warns everybody over a news broadcast not to go to Miami anytime soon because of the dangerous beast lurking there. The Loud family is among the people who watch the news broadcast, and the parents declare that despite the Sharkodile leading them to cancel their plans to go to Miami, they can still make the most of the situation by attending the tree-lighting ceremony at the mall that night. Meanwhile, Bobby's moped runs out of gas, leaving him and Lori stranded on the highway until further notice. Back at the Loud house, Lincoln has gotten dressed for the tree-lighting ceremony, but notices that many of his sisters are let down; Leni is upset because her boss fired her from her job at the mall because she ""lost"" the mannequin that Lincoln and Clyde stole and could not recover it, Luna is upset because Sam broke up with her as a result of her deciding to attend Mick Swagger's alleged concert instead of going skiing with her, Luan is disappointed because she got fired from her comedy gig, and everyone else is disappointed because they had plans for when they arrived in Miami. Suddenly, Lisa presents a Sharkodile-tranquilizing spray that she had just created as a means of hopefully protecting everyone from the beast. Concerned that it may not be safe, Lincoln tries to snatch it from her, but he accidentally sprays some of the spray into his father's eyes, which causes him to act insane before passing out. Suddenly, Rita gets a call from Lori about her being stuck on the highway with no working mode of transportation to head home, which prompts her to leave and pick up her oldest daughter before she and Bobby freeze to death. Suddenly, Lincoln gets a call from Clyde that tells him to turn on the news. During the news broadcast, he hears that the entire town has been placed under an emergency curfew because of the Sharkodile being spotted in town. (Earlier in the day, he and Clyde had hidden the fake beast in the woods, but they were recorded on camera, and the person who recorded the footage sent it to Katherine Mulligan, who once again believed it to be true.) With the town under emergency curfew, the tree-lighting ceremony at the mall is canceled, which upsets Lincoln even more than the news he had heard the previous day since he was looking forward to seeing Lily light the tree. He tries to call Mulligan and confess that the Sharkodile is a hoax and he was responsible for it, but the news reporter believes him to be a prank caller and ignores him. Lincoln then asks Clyde to help him prove that he is right, so the two of them retrieve the Sharkodile from the woods and drive it to the mall to reveal the truth to Mulligan. However, they get chased down by Rip Hardcore, a celebrity survival expert hired by Mulligan to protect people from the beast.

"African elephant Shani and her spirited son Jomo set out on an epic journey with their herd, traveling hundreds of miles across the vast Kalahari Desert, from the Okavango delta to the Zambezi River, just as countless generations of their ancestors have done before. Shani and her family are among the last elephants on earth to make these lengthy migrations. She's mother to wide-eyed, one-year-old Jomo, who has yet to experience a migration, and at 40 years old, she is next in line as herd matriarch, a position currently held by her older sister Gaia. Gaia's herd is among countless species - from hippopotamus to lechwe to baboons - that rely upon the life-giving water that flows from the mountains and transforms the heart of the desert into a green oasis known as the Okavango delta. But the season's end is near and soon there will be a mass exodus. Nothing on Earth is more precious to life than water. And perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than the Kalahari desert in southern Africa, one of the driest places on the planet. The water is receding and paradise will soon turn to dust as the delta becomes a series of vanishing pools. Gaia instinctively knows she must lead the herd directly into the baking Kalahari desert, before the remaining water holes dry up. The herd's success will depend on her experience and wisdom, which has been handed down over many generations. Just as the saying ""an elephant never forgets"" implies, these massive mammals have a deep connection to their past. Gaia will take her family down ancient elephant paths, networks of lines and circles - the circles being water holes the family will desperately need to cross the vast desert. Along the way, they'll seek nourishment from sources such as moisture-rich mopane leaves and baobab tree trunks filled with rainwater. As they near their destination, the herd must cross the mighty Zambezi River to reach the safe haven for which they've been searching. They must enter the shallows, where crocodiles prey upon elephant calves like Jomo, and fight a ferocious current that could draw them into the world's greatest waterfall, Victoria Falls. Fortunately, the herd has the strength and stamina to succeed and can rest while enjoying unlimited water and all the palm nuts they can shake from the trees. But within a few short months, food is scarce and the water begins its voyage back to the Okavango delta. The family must traverse the wilds of Africa, yet again. The march back to the delta will be no easy task, as the Angolan flood waters are early this year and the herd will need to make quick time. However, the emotional bonds between elephants are as strong as those between humans and the strength of family has gotten them this far. Together, Gaia, Shani, Jomo and family dare to take the shortest route - through lion country."

As she makes her way to the mysterious Wytness Quantum Research Centre to find a way to stop it, she begins to get glimpses into other worlds and other versions of herself. But each time she seems to be getting closer to an answer she is immediately reset back to the attic she fears, to once more start her journey to learn the truth.

There is evidence that life was once here, houses, cars and zeppelins hovering above, but everything is boarded up and abandoned. At night however, Jane sees torches and helicopters in the distance and discovers that soldiers are searching for her, adding to her desperation to get to the research centre and look for answers that might send her home.
Once inside the centre the laws of time become erratic and Jane sees glimpses of people who are clearly living in another world, but whose actions are having an effect on the one she is trapped in, and those effects are growing worse with every 'reset'."

"In the mountain town of Brooklyn, Colorado, Erin Chambers (Rochelle Aytes) works for the mayor's office as director of community development, due to nepotism. Her father, Raymond Chambers (Peter Bryant) is the mayor. Erin is tasked with planning the town's Christmas festival to promote holiday tourism since the town has experienced an economic downturn due to the loss of two factories the past year. At the end of a city council meeting, it is revealed the chosen Christmas tree for the Christmas tree lighting has root disease and Steve (Mark Dozlaw) the intern is tasked with finding a replacement. While visiting her friend's Phoebe (Laura Bertram) and Tom Tate (Joel Stephanson) in their new home, Erin sees a large Norway spruce. Erin also notices a hunky neighbor named Kevin Snyder (Mark Taylor) and his adorable daughter Claire (Grace Sunar) building a snowman by the beautiful tree in his yard. Claire determines the tree would be perfect for the town's Christmas tree.
Erin introduces herself and helps Kevin and Claire add stability to the crooked snowman they are building. That night, Erin accidentally posts a photo of the tree on the city's home page. Everyone at city hall thinks that Erin has found the perfect Christmas tree and is already using it to promote the city. Erin visits the handsome man Kevin, at his place of employment. Kevin is the lieutenant at the fire station. He is confused about why Erin is visiting and wanting to cut down his tree for the mayor. Kevin believes the mayor is poorly allocating resources, as his fire department has just experienced budget cuts meaning they will lose expected equipment and hours. Kevin refuses to give up his tree.
Kevin's coworker Mitch Cohen (Matt Hamilton) questions Kevin about Erin's visit and promotes her as an attractive option for Kevin's personal life. At dinner, the Mayor presses Erin on the tree's acquisition and tells her it is her destiny to become the mayor one day. Kevin returns Erin's winter hat she left in his office. He notices a mock-up of the layout for the tree lighting display. It potentially has numerous safety and fire code violations. Erin chases Kevin out the door to hire him as a safety consultant. Kevin agrees to help if he can get a budget meeting with the mayor and Erin drops her desire to use his tree for the town's tree lighting.
Kevin and Erin meet the next morning and review the tree lighting sight and adjust the layout to accommodate Kevin's safety concerns. Kevin expresses that he has not found a way to share holiday merriment with Claire. Erin suggests the many varied Christmas events the city has planned. When Kevin has a meeting with Parks and Recreation, he brings Claire along as his deputy. Claire makes snow angel with other kids while Kevin tells Erin how he adopted Claire when she was five and how he was also adopted. Erin injects to teach Claire the proper snow angel technique and even Kevin gives it a try. Then Erin takes Claire to a gingerbread decorating contest hosted by her mother Mary (Liza Huget), the West Brooklyn Elementary School principal. Erin makes friends with Kevin's adopted daughter Claire. Kevin arrives later to help with the gingerbread house. The budding romance is stopped cold in its tracks when Neil Stephens (Jason McKinnon) Erin's co-worker, the city treasurer, hits on her in front of Kevin by betting dinner on the outcome of the gingerbread house contest.
Kevin and Claire invite Erin to the firehouse Christmas party. While Kevin and Mitch Cohen shop for supplies for the party, Erin and Neil make a date for Monday night. Erin arrives at the firehouse for the party with many children from the local children's home. Kevin enlists Erin as a mentor for the children's home program. Erin and Claire team up in a three-legged race and defeat Kevin and his partner. The chemistry between Kevin and Erin cannot be denied. Kevin lets Erin sit in the driver's seat of the firetruck. They almost kiss in a firetruck but are interrupted by overzealous horn honking Kevin.
Erin stops by Kevin's house as he is hauling in a Christmas tree. Erin, Claire and Kevin all decorate the tree before they are off to visit Santa. Erin features a photo of Kevin and Claire on Brooklyn social media page. Kevin is not happy. He confronts Erin at city hall and she takes him into her office where she explains the financial desperation that Brooklyn is in and is using social media to try to help the children's home and the fire department at the same time. They end up kissing when Neil knocks reminding Erin of their date that night.
Erin is nervous at dinner with Neil, not having been on a date in a while, until Neil announces he is gay. The next morning, Erin admits to her father that she has been unable to negotiate with Kevin for his tree and the mayor is disappointed. Erin invites Neil to a caroling event as friends, but Kevin hasn't gotten the memo about Neil being gay. While searching for a new tree for the Christmas tree lighting, Kevin apologizes for kissing Erin, calling it a ""mistake"". Neil starts hanging out with his co-worker/gay firefighter Mitch Cohen after they meet while planning the layout for the town square.
Erin helps kids in the elementary school create ornaments for the town tree while her father and Kevin make improvements to the town square renovation plans. Erin then invites Kevin out for a drink. Kevin offers the advice that Erin doesn't need to follow her father's rise in politics if it doesn't make her happy while Erin thinks it would benefit Claire to see her dad going out and having fun.
The local newspaper puts pressure on the mayor and questions his ability to keep his promises for struggling Brooklyn using the Christmas tree as an example. Kevin bumps into Erin out doing late Christmas shopping. She suggests a magic set for Claire's present. Erin agrees to babysit Claire so he can have a night out with the boys.
The city sends a letter to Kevin stating they are going to take the tree due to eminent domain. Erin is not involved. While babysitting Claire and Erin make cookies. The night is ruined when Kevin opens the letter and gets angry at Erin for keeping it from him. The next day, Erin gets upset with her dad who is not doing anything to stop the city council s action. Kevin's mom and dad arrive for Christmas. They remind Kevin that use of his tree is an honor and he will be a part of helping Brooklyn get back on its feet.
Maggie, the mayor's assistant, comes through and finds a loophole that she shares with Erin. Kevin's land is a historical landmark. The tree cutters stop just in time and the decision to cut down the tree is left up to Kevin. Erin arrives at the town square, sees a heart-shaped marking on the trunk, and realizes that it is Kevin's tree. She tells her father that she is resigning from her position and plans to become a teacher instead. The mayor goes to Kevin's house and explains that Erin was not responsible for the decision to use his tree, and in fact, incited the heritage clause to save it.
Kevin watches Erin give a speech on TV about how important it is to spend time with your loved ones at Christmas. He rushes down to the square and apologizes for the many, many misunderstandings the couple has had. Kevin donated the tree and Erin did put the call in in time to stop the tree cutting. Kevin is happy the tree is giving so many people joy. The only thing that gives him joy is Erin. They kiss as the Christmas tree is lit."

"The Atlantic's first feature documentary is the definitive inside story of the movement that has come to be known as the alt-right. With unprecedented access, White Noise tracks the rise of far-right nationalism by focusing on the lives of three of its main proponents: Mike Cernovich, a conspiracy theorist and sex blogger turned media entrepreneur; Lauren Southern, an anti-feminist, anti-immigration YouTube star; and Richard Spencer, a white-power ideologue. Directed and shot by Daniel Lombroso in his directorial debut, this film takes the viewer into the terrifying heart of the movement -- explosive protests, riotous parties, and the rooms where populist and racist ideologies are refined, weaponized, and injected into the mainstream. Just as the alt-right comes to prominence, infighting tears the movement apart. Spencer and Cernovich clash over the role of white nationalism in conservative politics. Southern struggles to reconcile her leadership role with the sexism and misogyny of her peers. Lawsuits mount and internecine fights erupt, but even as the alt-right fractures, its once-marginalized ideas find a foothold in mainstream discourse; in Republican politics; in the establishment right-wing press, especially Fox News -- and on the world's biggest social-media platforms. As white-nationalist violence surges in America and across the world, White Noise represents an urgent warning about the power of extremism, and where it's going next."

"Tom is the owner of a used bookstore in New York City. One day, a woman named Sandra comes in looking for a book, and after initially declining his advances, the two begin a romance. Weeks into their relationship, Sandra tells Tom that her brother is in debt and must pay $350,000 or be killed. Tom reveals that his father is wealthy, and offers to cover the debt. After providing the money to Sandra, she disappears, pushing Tom into a nervous breakdown.
Sandra's past is revealed as a parolee with a long criminal history. One night, before her relationship with Tom, she is meeting with her parole officer, who attempts to shake her down for money. She is paid off by an apparently wealthy man, Max, who is actually a con artist. He takes Sandra on as a partner, and trains her to pull cons. After taking down their first mark together, the two have sex.
Before his partnership with Sandra, Max visits his mother, Madeline, and her new boyfriend, billionaire Richard Hobbes, at Richard's lavish apartment. Max, who appears drunk and belligerent, convinces Madeline to allow him to stay at Richard's apartment. The next day, Madeline and Richard come home to Max apparently being arrested for soliciting drugs from an undercover police officer. Madeline quickly realizes that Max is pulling a con to have Richard pay off the officer, Max's partner Tipsy. Madeline forces Max to leave the apartment, but it is later revealed that Madeline and Max are lovers, not mother and son, and are targeting Richard.
Richard meets with Max, who demands a year's salary in cash in order to leave Madeline alone to be with Richard. While meeting with him, Max also meets Richard's son-Tom, who has not yet met Sandra. Max, Madeline, and Tipsy celebrate a successful job, but that evening, Madeline tells Max that Richard wants to marry her, and she will be staying with him. Max escapes from the police Madeline has called and leaves with the money.
Richard dies, leaving the vast majority of his estate to Madeline. Due to Richard's misgivings about Tom after the incident with Sandra, Tom has been left only the bookstore. He has also been named chairman of Richard's foundation, while Madeline is a trustee.
Tom hires an old family friend, Braddock, to locate Sandra. Despite Madeline's attempts to convince Tom to call off the investigation, Sandra is found, heavily addicted to heroin. Tom wants her to stay at the apartment while she goes through detox, but Madeline is reticent. She speaks to Sandra, who reveals that she knows the connection between Madeline and Max. In return for her silence, Sandra demands that Madeline track down Max so she can confront him about abandoning her.
Max agrees to meet with Sandra and Madeline. During the meeting, Tom and Braddock arrive to confirm Tom's suspicions that the three had been working together. Tom pulls a gun on Sandra, then on Madeline. Sandra forces the gun out of Tom's hands, and it is picked up by Madeline, who apparently shoots and kills Tom after he forces her to point the gun at him and pull the trigger. Desperate to avoid prison, Madeline immediately transfers all the money to Richard's foundation.
Madeline, Max, and Sandra are put on a plane to Oklahoma City. Madeline reminds Max that she will retain control of the money, since Tom is dead and she is the trustee of Richard's foundation. After a distraught Sandra retreats to the bathroom, Madeline realizes that the blood on her sleeve is not real, meaning Tom is alive. When Madeline checks the bathroom, Sandra is gone.
The true nature of the scheme is revealed; Sandra-who prefers going by ""Sandy""-confesses the truth to Tom and the two devise a plan to con Madeline and Max, enlisting Tipsy and his partner Goldie-who posed as ""Braddock""-to assist them. The meeting between Sandra and Max was planned, as was Tom's apparent shooting at Madeline's hands. Since Tom is still alive, he maintains control over the foundation and the money. Tom, Sandra, Tipsy, and Goldie meet at the bookstore to celebrate their success. Tom and Sandra begin to rekindle their relationship."

"In 1988, Henk Rogers of Bullet-Proof Software markets his newest video game at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. While there, he instead becomes enamored with the game ""Tetris"", created by Russian programmer Alexey Pajitnov, who works for ELORG in the Soviet Union. Rogers explains to a bank manager that Robert Stein of Andromeda Software had obtained the worldwide licensing rights to Tetris from ELORG, and signed a contract with media tycoon Robert Maxwell and his son, CEO of Mirrorsoft, Kevin Maxwell, allowing them to distribute Tetris in exchange for game royalties. Meanwhile, the Mirrorsoft representative at CES had sold Rogers the Tetris rights in Japan for PC, console, and arcade. Rogers then goes to Nintendo headquarters in Japan and obtains an audience with CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi, whom he convinces of Tetris' value. He turns down a buyout offer for the rights to Tetris, instead proposing a partnership, to which Yamauchi agrees. Rogers then asks for a loan to produce Nintendo cartridges and arcade machines, agreeing to heightened interest rates and putting up his apartment as collateral. His wife and business partner Akemi voices her concerns, but Rogers points out their children's obsession with the game and promises that his gambit will work. Shortly after beginning production, Rogers receives a call from Kevin, explaining that the arcade rights had already been promised to Sega. Rogers returns to Yamauchi, asking for his residuals in advance. Instead, he is sent to Nintendo of America headquarters in Seattle, and shown Nintendo's upcoming handheld device, the Game Boy, which is planned to be released with Super Mario Land. Rogers convinces president Minoru Arakawa and senior VP Howard Lincoln to package it with Tetris instead, and promises to obtain the handheld licensing rights. He travels to meet with the Maxwells in London, who tell him that Stein retains all worldwide licensing rights. Rogers attempts to purchase the handheld rights, but is dismissed. The Maxwells order Stein to secure the handheld rights. Kevin questions his father about millions of pounds missing from the employee retirement fund, but his questions are dismissed. Rogers meanwhile, meets Stein outside and offers $25,000 for the worldwide handheld rights, which Stein seemingly accepts. Later, however, Arakawa and Lincoln call Rogers explaining that Stein has now promised the handheld rights to Atari for $100,000. Kevin learns about this, and, while Stein promises to obtain the rights, both Kevin and Rogers decide to travel to Moscow to personally obtain them instead. Rogers struggles to locate ELORG headquarters until he meets a woman named Sasha, who offers to be Rogers' translator. She takes him to ELORG, warning him that entry without formal invitation is highly illegal; despite this, Rogers speaks to ELORG president Nikolai Belikov. With Sasha translating, Rogers explains that he licenses Tetris to Nintendo. Belikov however, has never heard of Nintendo and claims that ELORG only licensed Tetris for PC, and accuses Rogers of theft. Rogers promises to sort out the situation, and Belikov tells him to return the next morning. Outside, Rogers is confronted by a KGB agent, who warns him to return home. Kevin arrives in Moscow and is greeted by Valentin Trifonov, head of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. The next morning, Rogers meets with Belikov and Alexey. Trifonov briefly interrupts to warn Rogers that he can return home or face the consequences of his crimes of fraudulently using a tourist's visa to conduct business and of false licensing, but Rogers refuses to leave. He promises Alexey that he will make him a millionaire, but Alexey explains that he receives no royalties for Tetris, despite having invented it. Rogers again defends himself to Belikov, and finds out that ELORG did not license the arcade rights either. Meanwhile, Stein and Kevin are also at ELORG to negotiate for handheld rights, though neither Rogers, Stein nor Kevin are aware of the others' presence. Rogers reviews the contract Stein originally signed and notes that because of the vague definition of the word ""computer,"" Stein had technically obtained the video game rights, though he had stolen the arcade rights. Belikov presents Stein with a new contract for arcade and PC rights. Rogers asks Alexey for a ride to his hotel, during which he attempts small talk. Alexey responds coldly, but, while it is illegal for USSR citizens to have foreigners in their homes, he gives Rogers his home address. Meanwhile, Trifonov meets with Kevin, explaining his lowly origins and that he believes the Soviet Union is dying. He also hints that Kevin should bribe him for help obtaining the rights. Although Kevin refuses, Robert promises Trifonov a large sum to help Kevin obtain them. Rogers goes to Alexey's apartment for dinner, where they bond over their passion for game design. Rogers plays the original version of Tetris on Alexey's personal computer, suggesting improvements to the game's mechanics. When a neighbor knocks on their door, Alexey and his wife fearfully hide Rogers. Alexey asks Rogers to leave, but Rogers asks Alexey to take him to a real Russian club, where he is surprised by the Russians' desire for freedom and love of the song ""The Final Countdown,"" and Alexey notes that he and Rogers are not so different. Afterwards, men from the Russian embassy in Tokyo threaten Rogers' family, while KGB officers beat him in an alley. He returns to his hotel and finds his room ransacked. Sasha arrives and tells Rogers that her room was also ransacked, and explains why the government considers him such a threat. She kisses him unexpectedly, but Rogers tells her he is married. The next morning, Trifonov speaks to Alexey and his sons, telling them to ask about what happened to Alexey's father. Rogers and Stein see each other hailing taxis the next morning. Stein signs the new contract, and Rogers makes an offer for the handheld rights, offering royalties per unit sold to make up for the small sum he can pay up front; he expects millions of units to be sold. Trifonov tells Belikov to sell to Mirrorsoft, even though Kevin offers no royalties. Belikov has Kevin sign a letter of intent, giving the handheld rights to Mirrorsoft if the company pays 1 million dollars within a week; however, he also secretly has Rogers sign a letter, giving him a window to make a stronger counteroffer, and also offers the video game rights to Rogers; he had redefined the word computer in Stein's new contract, eliminating the loophole that Stein had exploited. Alexey takes Rogers to Dzerzhinsky Square. On the way, he tells Rogers that his father was a university professor, and that when his father protested a colleague's arrest over selling a book abroad, the Soviet government ruined his family. He then points out Trifonov, and reveals that Sasha is actually a KGB agent working for Trifonov, before taking Rogers to the airport. When Rogers arrives home, he receives a fax from ELORG reneging his deal, and photos of him kissing Sasha to blackmail him into silence. He then receives a call from Lincoln stating that Nintendo is purchasing the rights from Mirrorsoft. As he despairs, Rogers angrily dismisses having missed his daughter's concert as unimportant, which upsets both her and Akemi.
Belikov has Alexey fax Mirrorsoft's letter of intent to Rogers. Meanwhile, Kevin finds his father shredding numerous documents. When he questions why the company could not pay the million dollars, Robert again is dismissive. Rogers takes the letter to Lincoln and Arakawa, who are angrily discussing the loss of Tetris and their cartridge patent to Atari. However, since Mirrorsoft had not yet paid the million dollars they promised, both the worldwide video game and handheld rights were still available. The three travel back to Moscow to make another offer, and Trifinov has Alexey fired from his job and evicted from his apartment because of Rogers' return.
Rogers, Lincoln, and Arakawa meet with Belikov and make an offer for worldwide handheld and video game rights. Sasha, who is also present, forces Belikov to consider the offer overnight and informs Trifonov, who in turn informs Robert, giving him twenty-four hours to come up with the one million dollars originally promised. Stein angrily attacks Kevin for going behind his back, believing that Kevin had caused him to lose the video game rights, although Kevin denies this. The three realize that they possess neither video game nor handheld rights, and Robert and Kevin fly to Moscow to meet with Mikhail Gorbachev, asking for help, but Gorbachev refuses. Alexey meets with Rogers, angrily stating that they are not friends, and should return to their own worlds. As he returns home, he overhears Trifonov's orders to intercept Rogers' team from the agents watching him.
The Maxwells attempt to convince Belikov to give them the licensing rights, but Rogers' team interrupts and presents their own offer. Kevin accidentally forces Robert to admit that Mirrorsoft is bankrupt, and couldn't pay the one million dollars they promised. Belikov dismisses the Maxwells and signs Rogers' offer, warning that the three are not safe until they are out of Moscow. Trifonov confronts the Maxwells, inadvertently revealing the bribe to Sasha and Kevin. Trifonov's men attempt to intercept Rogers outside, but Alexey arrives in his car and helps Rogers escape. A car chase ensues, with Alexey getting to the airport ahead of Trifinov. When they hear police sirens, Rogers tells Alexey to return home, promising that it is not goodbye. Trifinov attempts to intercept Rogers, but he manages to trick him and the flight departs before Trifinov can board, and Sasha arrests him for corruption.
When he arrives home, Rogers apologetically asks his daughter to perform her concert that he missed, and shows Akemi a check from Nintendo for five million dollars, reconciling with them both. The Game Boy goes on to become an enormous success worldwide. As the Soviet Union collapses, Rogers sends Alexey a Game Boy and plane tickets to America, and meets him in San Francisco, where the two embrace. Text then reveals that Stein continued licensing video games, and that Robert had stolen millions of pounds from employee funds, for which Kevin stood trial, and discusses the success and legacy of Tetris."

Her friend Tony, who works at a community center mostly shut down for the holidays, lets her know about a job posted on the center's bulletin board for people to be part of The Santa Squad, which does personal services all things related to Christmas. Showing her prowess to Mr. Karl who does the hiring, she is assigned to work on the important ""church"" file, which she learns does not refer to a religious institution upon her arrival at her work-site, but rather the extremely wealthy Church family headed by widowed businessman Gordon Church. Her responsibilities will be to help prepare the Church mansion for Christmas to very detailed specifications, the minimalist elegance of those specifications seemingly dictated by Gordon's girlfriend, Kimmee. Through those responsibilities, Allie can see that Gordon's two adolescent daughters, Rose and Iris, are not considered inherently in what is happening for Christmas, which is probably an indication of the emotional neglect they face from their father, in his preoccupation with business, and Kimmee in general, although she can see that Gordon does love them.

"In New York City, Charity Jones aspires to become a hard hitting, serious journalist, her blog which she does not consider as legitimate journalism despite it having a modest following. She also writes for the Times Square Journal magazine, and with two weeks before Christmas, she is surprised to be the one chosen by the magazine's Managing Editor Janet Cohen to write the full page Christmas feature. The subject for the feature is the non-profit Never Stop Believing, a Christmas charity centered on making Christmas wishes come true - i.e. the giveaway personalized Christmas presents - for a select number of people, they having given away in excess of $2 million worth of ""wishes"" last Christmas. While they do fund-raise, the non-profit's founder, Erik Gallagher, seemingly would not have the financial means on his own to provide that amount of gifts in never having held a paying job besides one at a chocolate shop, and not coming from a wealthy background being a product of the foster care system, in addition to not having any corporate sponsors on the books. Whenever asked, he has always stated that the gifts are from Santa himself solely for those who believe. Janet thus wants the piece to be an exposé of the charity, the core of the story to be what Erik's angle is and how he is able to fund the charity, Janet implying that there must be some sort of fraud or unsavory angle involved. Erik, who agreed to the story, had no idea of Janet's chosen angle. He also agreed on the condition that whoever assigned to the story take part in the events leading up to the presents distributed on Christmas Day, namely a different seasonal themed charitable event open to the masses on each of the twelve days of Christmas, to understand fully the workings of the charity. Charity walks into the assignment as skeptical as Janet, and is as much so when she comes to the understanding that Erik's stock line is his true belief: that the personalized gifts are from Santa solely for the believers. But as Charity and Erik seem to start to fall for each other and Charity comes to believe that Erik at least wants earnestly to embody the spirit of Christmas through the charity, Charity gets caught in the middle by needing to stay true to what Janet wanted for the story with her job and career on the line against not wanting to hurt Erik, such a story regardless of the truth which would do so."
"During the 2019 European election campaign, Bernard-Henri Levy sets out to save Europe by travelling across the continent with a play written and performed by him. The film follows the relentless defender of the EU along the roads of some 20 intertwined countries, but also goes out of the theatres to meet situations and faces. The black and white aplomb of the character BHL underlines, in contrast, the colourful dress of Princess Europe, whose frail fabric is woven of unevenly distributed wealth, memories of war and promises of struggle. A mute migrant, the sweetness of Lisbon, the irruption of the Transcarpathian in the basement of an Ukrainian bar, a President who pretends that ""populism is the people"" or another one who mourns his country abandoned to free trade, Macron, Orban, Babis, well known and unknown people, are the characters of this story. We push the muddy or golden doors of all houses; we roam a common space, we capture, or leave, the theatrical adventure; and we listen to the chorus of the multitude rising above the jousts of power."

"Maggie Murphy, who operates her own investment brokerage firm in Minneapolis in partnership with her ex-boyfriend Jonathan Richardson, returns to her small hometown of Brattleboro, Vermont six months following the passing of her beloved Aunt Dee for the ""no tears"" will reading. Maggie and her sister Jody, who still lives in Brattleboro with her husband Eddie, was raised by Dee and her traditions, including always being around ""Aunt Dee's"", her small homemade candy store, and being involved in the organization of the town's Sweet Autumn Festival, which Dee started, for which Jody has taken over the organization, and the start of which this year coincides with Maggie's return. Although entering into the will reading with no expectations, Maggie is happy to learn that Dee has left her half ownership of the candy store, which Maggie, as she and Jonathan have done with many such small family businesses, would like to expand to make Aunt Dee's a household name nationally as she believes Dee would have wanted. However, Dee has left the other half of the business to Dex Walters, who has been helping in the store since he and his father Ron Walters moved to town a couple of years ago to operate the local maple tree farm. The problem is not only that Dex has no desire to expand as he believes Dee would have wanted, but that he and Maggie have had an antagonistic few encounters in her short time in town. Both Maggie and Dex want to buy the other out of the business, neither who seems to want to back down. For the remainder of Maggie's stay, they decide at least to meet in the middle to get to know where the other is coming from to be able to reach a compromise. What factors into what happens is that Dee has left each of them a series of inspirational letters, one for each of the seven days of the Sweet Autumn Festival, which may provide some insight into the larger picture of why she left the two of them each as half owner of the business."

"Beyond their mutual animosity stemming from their less-than-pleasant recent first encounter, it seems like Amelia Lewis and Vic Manning are always competing against each other, most importantly for a commercial property each wants to purchase in White Oak, Nevada for her/his dream store: hers a year-round Christmas store; his a chocolate shop. As each bid has its merits--hers all cash, his above asking--the real-estate agent must consult with the property owner who has the final say. Amelia and Vic separately have the same idea to discover the property owner's identity and make a personal plea directly to him: Elder Dubois, who lives an hour away in Castle Creek. They arrive there unannounced at about the same time to make individual pitches. Elder tells them that he is unable or unwilling to make a snap decision concerning the property. As Elder is all alone for Christmas for the first time since his wife recently passed and he's long been estranged from his young-adult daughter Marjorie, Amelia and Vic offer to help him with anything until he makes up his mind; he suggests that they chair Castle Creek Commercial Center's annual Christmas decorating competition. He and his wife always enjoyed doing that, but this year he hasn't the spirit without her. The competition, which is a bragging-rights-only one against the nearby town of Crystal, always seems to end up being a competition between Castle Creek's own merchants, which is probably the reason Crystal has won five years straight. The few things the Castle Creek merchants can agree on are the same Winter Wonderland theme year after year for ease, and featuring one merchant each year on a rotating basis. This year it's the pottery shop owned by the most outspoken and demanding of the bunch, Rowena Marson. In turn, Elder invites them to stay in his home rather than spending money on hotel rooms. In working on the decorating competition together, they must bring the merchants together as a cohesive whole--which means cooperating themselves. In the process, Amelia and Vic start to fall for each other. Could their emerging feelings be able to overcome their suspicions about each other concerning the property and the kind acts toward Elder, which could be seen solely as wanting that upper hand?"

When she learns that one of the staff photographers is out of commission for an upcoming article, Amy, with portfolio in hand, is able to convince her editor, Camilla, to give her the assignment on the caveat of sending some preliminary shots within short order for approval to proceed further. That assignment is to photograph the more elusive waterfalls of the Pinewood Lakes area, it uncertain if some of those waterfalls, most specifically Redwood Falls, actually exist or if they are just legends in there being no official records, photographic or otherwise.

"In Miami, 2000, and around the country, the Bush vs Gore for the presidency of the United States campaign is underway. The most talked-about issue leading up to the election was that whichever candidate won Florida, would win the whole thing. Miami, once a cultural wasteland in the 1970s and 1980s, emerged with the attractiveness of South Beach and the influx of the Cuban people. The Cubans become the heartbeat of city and dominate local politics on the peninsula. Alex Penelas is cast as America's sexiest politician. He had learned to be democrat and operate in the traditional Cuban ways successfully. He was elected the Executive Mayor of Dade County.
In the year leading up to this contest, one name would become synonymous with the disaster that it would become and that is Elian Gonzalez. Elian was an innocent little boy that survived a trip from Cuba to Florida - a trip in which he lost his mother - and became a pawn in the game of politics. The uproar was over whether or not Elian should remain in the United States or be sent back to Cuba to be with his father.
Armando Gutierrez, a very influential political consultant to judges, became the family spokesman. Rosa Rodriguez, a judge he helped elect, rules that Elian would stay in America for at least two more months until his case is resolved. Janet Reno, the US Attorney general, indicates that the case is a federal immigration matter. Gutierrez used the power of Cuban-American radio in the region to drive opinion. The Republican party took note and began to flock to Florida for photo opportunities with Elian. It became a divisive issue both between the Democrats and the G.O.P but also between Clinton and Gore. At one point, Mayor Penelas said the potential protests and violence would be at the hands of Reno and Clinton. Then, in a Ted Koppel interview, Penelas backed down and promised local support if federal intervention became necessary.
The outcome finally came when Janet Reno gave the go-ahead to forcibly remove Elian from his Miami home and have him sent back to his father in Cuba. Riots ensued, blame was placed, and payback was sought. A revenge vote against the democrats was promised and pledged to George W. Bush. Penelas, funded by democrats, won reelection for mayor in September, 2000. In October, however, Penelas failed to appear at a press conference organized by the Gore campaign where Penelas and the mayor of Hialeah were set to endorse Gore and support his remarks that he did not agree with the Clinton administration's action against Elian. George W. Bush relied on his brother, Florida governor Jeb Bush to spur a big turn out the vote effort. Both Gore and Bush held rallies in South Florida as the campaign season neared its end.
On election day, November 7, 2000, the television networks called Florida for Al Gore early in the evening. Later they had to recant and put Florida back in the undecided column. Fox news was the first network to declare Florida for George W. Bush and declare him the winner of the presidential election. The other networks followed suit and Al Gore made a concession call to George W. Bush. However, on the way to the War Memorial in Nashville where Gore was to speak to his supporters, he made another call to Bush withdrawing his concession on the advice of his advisers. The final tallies showed that Bush had won by just over 900 votes which triggered an automatic recount in the state.
Katherine Harris, the Florida Secretary of State, was put in charge of the recount despite her major role in the Bush campaign in Florida. The Democrat sent in Warren Christopher to represent Gore in the recount. He treated the controversy as a high-minded constitutional debate. James Baker was the official G.O.P representative and he was assisted by Roger Stone. First, Palm Beach County voters protested a confusing ballot where 19000 ballots were tossed out for double punches. On the butterfly ballot, Pat Buchanan's name was slightly above Al Gore's name which was claimed to cause confusion. Satisfied that efforts were satisfactory in that county. Stone headed to Miami Dade county. The voting machines in Miami Dade County were IBM punch card readers. If the machines were not properly cleaned, sometimes chads were not pushed through or hung on the ballot and were not counted. As the machine recounts proceed, Gore demands a manual recount of ballots which Bush rejects. Oddly, Miami-Dade County elections officials do not begin recounts when other counties do. Only when a board of local officials vote, a manual recount of ballots begins. The Bush campaign sues that the hand recount should be stopped. Republicans organize supporters on the street in front of the counting centers. They created slogans and t-shirts including the creative ""Sore Loserman"" placard as a play on words of Gore Lieberman yard sigh. The Gore campaign fought in the courts and at the counting centers but did not participate in the street battles and thus lost in the court of public opinion.
On November 21, the courts allowed a five day deadline for recounts to conclude. Further they ruled the uncounted ballots should be considered. The Democrats won that that round of litigation. Approximately 10,700 ballots in Miami Dade County were set aside because the machines could not count them. Republican operatives lead by Roger Stone incited protesters to storm the counting center demanding to see the ballots. The Chairman of the Democratic party is accused of stealing a ballot and chased by protesters. Meanwhile, Mayor Alex Penelas was said to be meeting with republican leaders in Tallahassee bargaining to carve out a congressional district for his future run. This became know at the Brooks Brothers Brigade riot.
Given the approaching deadline, the three-member canvassing board in Miami-Dade votes to stop the manual recount. Two of the three members of the canvassing board had been clients of Armando Gutierrez. The court battles continue. The 3rd District Appeals court does not require the recount to continue. Then the Florida Supreme Court orders all counties to hand count uncounted votes. Finally, the United States Supreme Court halts all recounts giving George W. Bush the win. Democrats claim the election was stolen. Gore makes a concession speech. Alex Penelas was scapegoated by Democrats because he did not control the Brooks Brothers uprising. Gore singles him out as dishonest and treacherous politician which effectively ends his political career.
Questions persist how much might have changed if the Miami Dade votes had been counted and how different the world might be. The history of the United States may well be different in its progress on climate change, the wars it entered during the Bush administration, how the 911 tragedy might have been avoided. It was theorized that this election marked the large political divide that the United State experiences today"

But as Liv and Casey start to fall for each other, a future for them could be placed in jeopardy if the paparazzi finds her, they who could manufacture any story they want with the right photograph--unless Liv can provide the truth to combat that which is made up."

When Scott is brought into the regional office for training under Margie, they will get an opportunity to deepen their relationship in the probability that he is training for a job in the Boise office. Meanwhile, Pat, now divorced and the primary parent to adolescent sons PJ and John, has just sold his outdoor-adventure company in Hawaii for a job in Boise to be closer to his ex-wife Casey in San Francisco for the boys' sake, and to be closer to his now-widowed mother Lois, with whom they'll be living until they find something more permanent. Pat's job falls through so he scrambles to find another. He had planned to contact Margie in the New Year just as old friends, but fate seems to usurp Pat and they accidentally run into each other...again and again and again. While Lois believes their encounters are ""Godwinks"" at work telling them that they are meant to be together, which is the case if they listen to their hearts, their brains might be telling them something else. Pat feels his first priority is to find that job regardless of what that actually means in practical terms, and Margie feels the need to explore what a more-dedicated relationship with Scott entails, while both begin to believe that Scott being brought in for training at the Boise office means work changes for both of them, and not necessarily in a good way for Margie."
"Working on the fourth in her successful anthology-romance series featuring ""in love"" characters Desmond Ranes and Catarina, Izzi Simmons is told by her best friend and editor Mila that the ending of her first draft, already past due, is unacceptable. Mila's take on the problem is that Izzi has made Desmond an unrealistic version of a romantic character in being ""perfect"", which matches Izzi's own unrealistic pursuit of a man. With Mila unwilling to push the final deadline past Christmas Eve--less than a week away--as Izzi requests, Izzi is able to convince her to let her work on the necessary edits from the Antler Lodge in Silver Springs. Since her parents moved to Florida, Izzi, a winter-wonderland traditionalist in her view of the perfect Christmas, has found the Lodge her Christmas home away from home, especially as its proprietor Bob is as much a traditionalist as she is. The only reason Mila allows this working vacation is that Bob informed Izzi that he's retiring and selling the lodge so it may not be the same retreat next year. When she arrives, she learns that he sold it to his son Matt, a widower of three years, who wanted to moves himself and his adolescent daughter Kacey back to Silver Springs for family reasons after moving a large hotel in Seattle. What immediately strikes Izzi about Matt is that he is the exact image of the paintings of Desmond used for her book covers, and she discovers that nobody associated with the publishing company knows who was originally commissioned for that job. Her thoughts that Matt might be her Desmond quickly dissolve as he displays human flaws, even in basic maintenance--he wants to transform the lodge into what she sees as against her Christmas sensibility. As Matt and Izzi spend more time together, and Matt himself discovers the issue of the book-cover likeness and knowing the reason behind it, Izzi starts to see in Matt the true nature of what Desmond should be, while Matt begins to wonder if meeting Izzi in this manner is a sign that he is ready to start another romance. to begin a romantic life again. What might affect this is the arrival of Matt's childhood friend Jennifer, who has long been in love with him herself."
"Cheryl Jenkins is the Deputy Director at the Federal Science Association in Washington DC. She only accepted the job evaluating grant proposals five years ago while she waited for a job in her chosen field of Astronomy, and now she's been at the Association five years longer than she wanted instead of doing real scientific research. On her week-long working trip home to Wellsboro for the Christmas holidays, Cheryl muses about the ""what-ifs"" of that fateful week five years ago that led her on this path to work at the Association. At the annual Wellsboro Christmas Carnival, Cheryl steps onto the solitary carousel by herself, only to step off it five years in the past at the start of that fateful week. She begins to believe she can make different decisions and have some impact, knowing now what she didn't know then to change the past, such as fixing the disastrous sole date with her high-school crush, current Mayor Terrence Fletcher; influencing the career path of her younger sister Trish, whose dream of opening her own restaurant Cheryl has always seen as a mistake; and, most importantly avoiding the meeting with her current boss, Dr. Phillips, so that she would never have known about that job at the Association. She also wants to bask in things she knows she can't change about the present, like spending more time with her mentor, her high-school science teacher Miss Nelson, who passed away unexpectedly shortly thereafter. This entails also spending time with her high-school adversary George Campbell, who worked alongside Miss Nelson. As Cheryl tries to change her past for a different present, she might find a different understanding about many issues upon closer examination."
"At Mission City Middle School, the day begins. Principal Addison Tate (Cindy Sampson) begins her day with a very specific coffee order and the need to quash rumors amongst the staff concerning the school's demise because of budget cuts in the district. Meanwhile, movie star Dylan Davidson (Steve Byers) discusses his lack of meaningful roles with his agent Garth Turnbull (Arnold Pinnock), when a phone call arrives which reveals Dylan has been rejected for a movie shoot in Europe. Garth also advises Dylan to stop dating models and find someone with substance.
Addison helps her father Bill decorate his Christmas tree lot. During the conversation, her father informs Addison, her ex-boyfriend Mark has taken up with a new woman but assures his daughter he was not the one. Meanwhile, Garth reveals to Dylan that his ex-girlfriend Monique (Samantha Helt) is writing a tell all book that will stir things up in his life. Dylan suggests becoming a director which Garth agrees with if Dylan is willing to start small. In Mission City Middle School, Addison recruits Literature Teacher Phil to direct the school production of ""It's a Wonderful Elf"" and encourages a student named Liam (Aidan Vissers) to lead by example and take the play seriously. That afternoon, as she distributes fliers about the school's financial plight, Addison's best friend Judy Cole (Samora Smallwood) teases her about missing a New Year's kiss two years in a row.
After seeing her former high school boyfriend Dylan Davidson get bad press on TV, Addison brainstorms an idea that Dylan could direct the school play getting positive publicity for himself and raising funds to save the school. Then Bill calls his daughter telling her that the school is being tendered for an offer for sale and it has become even more likely the school will be closed. Phil helps Addison find the cell phone number of Dylan's agent and Addison places numerous calls to Garth's voicemail without a response. After Monique sends out more bad publicity on Twitter about Dylan, Garth accepts Addison's call with Dylan in the room. Dylan agrees to direct the school play realizing all the positive public perception it will generate. Both Dylan and Addison are excited to be reuniting.
Addison tells her father of Dylan's arrival over a plate of waffle. Dylan is interviewed immediately after stepping of the airplane and checks into the Bedford Guest House with his agent. That night Addison starts to decorate her home, watches old Christmas movies and bakes cookies for the teachers at school. Dylan stops at school and literally bumps into Addison. She gives Dylan the story of the school's financial woes. Dylan meets the students in the play and begins directing them, finding it a meaningful experience in tapping into the potential of others. Addison is impressed with the connection he is making. Dylan says they need to overcome the negative energy around the school and arrive at the conclusion they need a movie night. Dylan uses the movie to teach his middle school actors how emotionally invested the characters are in the movie. When the film break, Dylan walks Addison home and tells her he regrets not saying good bye when he left for Julliard. Addison's father texts her requesting her to come to the Christmas tree lot.
When they arrive at the tree lot, they find Bill Is injured after falling off a ladder. Garth agrees to take over the tree lot and help Bill out while he is in town. After they leave, Addison and Dylan make waffles. Dylan asks Addy if she is seeing anyone. When Garth returns from taking Addy's father home, he suggests Dylan walk Addy home. Addy admits she has no man in her life after breaking up with her fiancée Mark about a year earlier. Dylan starts to show a romantic interest in Addy, but receives a phone call. Suddenly, Monique is walking down the street toward Dylan and Addy. Addy insists that Addy book her a room in Dylan's hotel. Addison leaves to let them chat.
The next morning, Dylan and Garth and Addison and Judy are out taking separate walks sharing fond memories of their high school relationship. At play practice, Monique is only distracting and walks off with Dylan's cell phone when she leaves. Dylan goes to retrieve it and discovers Monique is using photos of him and the kids for her own publicity. When Monique tries to make up and kiss Dylan, Addison arrives and is upset that Dylan missed play practice. Addy retreats to her father's tree lot shack for hot chocolate. Garth says that Dylan's eyes light up when she is around. Addy runs into Phil ringing a bell to gather donations to save the school. He compliments her leadership in the school and sends her to the Christmas tree decorating in the town square.
The decorating and Christmas tree lighting inspire Addy to decorate her own home. Nearly completed, she realizes she does not have a tree. Dylan arrives with a tree. He charms his way into the house and apologizes for letting down the kids and her. They set up and begin decorating the noble fir when each gets a phone call. Monique has posted publicity about the ""Hollywood Has been"" and the ""Hometown Homewrecker"".
Suddenly, Dylan and Addy are trapped in the house by paparazzi. Liam and some friends pelt the reporters and photographers with snowballs and Dylan and Addy sneak out. They hole up in the Christmas tree shack. They decided to get their version of the story out and call the television reporter who greeted Dylan at the airport with an exclusive. Addy promotes the ""Save Our School"" campaign but is put on administrative leave because of the negative publicity circulating.
Dylan is offered the part in the European production that had previously passed on him. Garth admits it has been a difficult effort over the past year trying to find Dylan a quality part. Taking the job will mean he will not be in Mission City for the play. Meanwhile, Garth and Dylan have made a contact which clears Addy from administrative leave and will allow her to present at the budget review board meeting. Dylan explains the situation to Addy who does not pressure Dylan to stay. Dylan explains the situation to Liam and gives him confidence he will perform well without him.
Dylan asks Addy to join him in Bulgaria, but Addison is too preoccupied with trying to save her school. At the airport the next day, Garth calls the producer to see if they can delay Dylan's part of the shoot if they shave his fee. When Garth tells the producer Dylan is in love, he gets 10 extra days. Meanwhile, Addison is very nervous for the budget review and keeps rearranging the trees on her father's lot. She meets Judy who always has coffee for Addy and they head inside the meeting. After the meeting, Dylan is waiting outside and tells Addy he wants to finish what he started. Judy declares that Addy was remarkable at the meeting, but Addy reports despite this, the board still voted to close the school after Christmas.
As a final effort to raise funds, Dylan films a promotional commercial with the play's actors. Addy announces to the school that they need everyone to share the Save Our School link to all of the student's and staff's contacts on their social media. Before the performance, Addison thanks Dylan for all he has done to help the school.
On the night of the play, Liam is nervous and hiding in the boy's washroom. Addy finds him and gives him the confidence he needs. The play begins with Santa Claus missing. Liam locates him and puts the elves to work. At the end, the audience shows great appreciation for the performance. Dylan's name is chanted and he appears on stage. Then he credits Addy for making the entire evening possible. Addy is grateful to Dylan and the audience at home and in the auditorium, but mentions that they have fell short of their goal to save the school.
Suddenly, Garth requests the microphone. A screen drops as he wants to show the number one item trending on the internet: the speech Addy made to the school board. He then reveals the Save Our School website which indicates that their financial goal had been reached. Dylan tells Addy the reason why he never said goodbye to Addy when they were 17 was that he was afraid he couldn't bring himself to leave if he did. Addy admits she probably would not have let him leave. They smooch and the audience applauds.
On Christmas Eve, Addy, Garth, Bill, Dylan and Addy enjoy dinner together. When Dylan and Addy leave the table to fetch the pies from the kitchen for dessert, Dylan asks Addy if she will join him in Bulgaria. She says she will have to because she hasn't had time to get Dylan any other present. Dylan question Addy on how she prefers her pie and discovers she has very specific preferences. They both agree that Addison is very complex."

But if Lucy is being honest, her heart is on her Christmas side job of organizing for the last ten years Project Christmas Wish, which she created, it which tries to grant the holiday related wishes of town residents as best it can. Why she is so invested in this endeavor is in her own Christmas wish being granted when she and her mother Joyce were going through some difficult times upon the passing of Joyce's husband/Lucy's father when Lucy was a child, and thus she truly believing in the power of wishes. Project Christmas Wish highlights one wish every year as a means to engage the community. The wish that Lucy plans to highlight this year after an impromptu declaration on the radio is for eight year old Max, recently moved to town and having trouble finding her place. Her wish: to have a Merry Christmas like she used to before her mother passed three years ago, Max's father, Lucas, who has not been able to get into the Christmas spirit since in missing his wife, Stephanie.

Despite not wanting to be the focus of the town, Lucas feels that he has no other choice but to indulge Max in this very public granting of her wish. As Lucy goes about trying to make Max remember the joys of Christmas, especially with her mother no longer alive, Max decides to alter her wish in making it a Merry Christmas equally for her and for her father. In the process, Max may get that additional wish in Lucas and Lucy falling for each other. But a Merry Christmas this year may be in jeopardy if their mutual feelings are overtaken by both not yet being ready to open their hearts romantically, for Lucas in not wanting to forget Stephanie, and for Lucy in not wanting to be hurt again as was the case in the dissolution of her first marriage."

As Britt, Zee and Jeff go to the gallery first thing one morning to pick up the donated piece, they are sidetracked when they discover a dead body inside the otherwise locked and security alarm activated gallery, it an obvious case of homicide. Especially seeing as to his direct involvement, Chief Madieras asks for Jeff's unofficial assistance on the case. What little Jeff and Zee know of the victim is that she was a difficult person, meaning many who may have wanted her dead. She was also going through both personal and professional problems, some of those problems well known, which also could be motives for murder, some straddling the realm of the personal and professional. They also have to look into the possibility that the victim was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, as it could have been a case of a robbery gone awry, only one piece, one in series by local artist Carl Kilburn that looks to be missing. If they are to discover the murderer, they will have to look farther afield into the work of Zee's retired mentor, Dr. Eli Leichtner who is in the process of developing a revolutionary dialysis device he didn't want to patent but rather have as open source meaning access to the masses who would need it. Through it all, Jeff is in contact with his former colleague, Detective Andy Lau, for any leads on who killed Jeff's partner, and who fired the gun with the bullet that is still lodged close to his spine."

"Lindsey Johnson has long worked as a manager in the property-acquisition section of Manhattan-headquartered Krispen Group, a chain of upscale modern resort hotels. It is in her ability to close the deal that company CEO Drake Krispen reassigns her from a near completed Paris acquisition to the starting negotiations in a potentially more problematic one in the small coastal town of Kilabbey, Ireland. The problem with the property is that a castle sits on it which Krispen would tear down to replace with a modern building, whereas the Town Council, which owns the castle, has been known to be reluctant to sell to anyone who would not maintain it. Lindsey, who has some Irish blood, is making her initial visit to meet with Council coinciding with the town's historic annual Matchmaking Festival. In meeting with Council, she discovers their reluctance to sell to someone like Krispen, the lead Council member, Alroy, who advises her to learn more about Kilabbey and its environs before ever approaching them again. Purely as a high profile move to show Council that she is listening to them, Lindsey reluctantly stays for the Matchmaking Festival just because she knows most of the Council members are highly-involved in its operation. While most Council members welcome Lindsey's involvement despite knowing her ulterior motive so having no intention of finding a match, one, Brennan O'Brien, doesn't. He's arguably the most protective of the castle, taking any opportunity to sabotage her involvement. While some developments complicate matters, two of the more important are: that Lindsey has no idea that Council has never had the money to maintain the property, so would be more than willing to sell; and that Lindsey and Brennan start to fall for each other. Lindsey wants to close the deal and does not want to hurt Brennan."

"Chernobyl: The Lost Tapes
The story of Chernobyl told through a newly discovered hoard of dramatic footage filmed at the nuclear plant during the disaster and newly-recorded, deeply personal interviews of those who were there, directed by Emmy Award-winner and Russian-speaker James Jones.
This gripping film tells the story of the disaster and its consequences entirely through extraordinary and immersive archive, shot at great risk in the hours, days, weeks and months after the accident by a handful of cameramen given access to the plant. These cameramen lived side by side with the ""liquidators"" who went to incredible and often fatal lengths to try to prevent another explosion and make the reactor safe.
The reality of their bravery and heroism is more harrowing than any drama can portray. The footage, most of it never seen before in the West, has only now come to light after an extensive trawl by director James Jones of the state archives and other sources in Ukraine and Russia.
For thirty-five years the story of what happened in April 1986 when the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant melted down has enthralled and horrified. Radio programmes and scripted dramas have all told their version of events. But no-one has made a documentary that reveals the full, shocking reality of this cataclysmic, world changing event - until now.
Though many of the rescue workers died, a surprising number who appear prominently in the footage are still alive today. The film features newly recorded audio interviews with people involved in the original key moments of the footage - their memories of that fateful night and the aftermath haunting but also deeply humane.
Amongst those interviews is Lyudmila Ihnatenko, whose firefighter husband Vasily died days after the accident, and who was pregnant at the time. She went onto lose her baby hours after she was born. ""All the radiation I was inhaling, she absorbed it."" From a ten-year-old schoolboy to a Russian general, we see how events at Chernobyl transformed the lives of millions of people.
Soviet propaganda plays out as a backdrop, initially saying nothing of the disaster, Gorbachev eventually appearing to downplay what happened, putting his own citizens and the rest of the world at great risk. The film reveals how many people suffering from radiation poisoning, cancer and other illnesses were told that it had no connection to the accident. The state was in denial and was willing to lie to its own citizens to prevent the truth getting out. This film witnesses the incredible physical suffering of men who had sacrificed themselves for the greater good.
The film shows how Chernobyl and the cover-up that followed sparked unprecedented distrust in the authorities, giving birth to a protest movement in Ukraine which would eventually lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union. The modern resonance of a disaster which threatened millions of lives but was tragically mishandled by those in authority will have an obvious resonance to the contemporary audience.

"It is the busiest season for the Golden Dragon, a Chinese restaurant long owned and operated by first-generation immigrants Jim and Sue Chen in Wichita, Kansas, as it is one of the few restaurants open on Christmas Day, when ""Christmas misfits"" frequent the establishment, including many of their regulars. It's the first Christmas for Jane since her husband's unexpected passing from a heart attack, he the basketball coach at the University of Wichita. While Jane is having a hard time moving on without him, she laments that her daughter Veronica, a high-powered CFO at a tech company, seems to have easily put him in her past, fixated on remembering that he was ""never"" there for the family in favor of his high-profile career. Veronica also needs to move on from her latest-of-many unsuccessful IVF treatment. Veronica's work colleague, engineer Nate, is determined to make Christmas merry for his two adolescent daughters, Jessa and Vivi, after his recent divorce from their mother--and trying a bit too hard for Jessa's taste. The restaurant being open on Christmas also means a working day for Jim and Sue's staff, including their two young-adult offspring Romy and Rick, who have never had what most would consider a traditional Christmas. Their busboy/delivery boy, Miguel, a second-generation Mexican-American, has received early acceptance into many of the nation's most prestigious colleges, but he hasn't told his father Luis, because he can't go unless he gets a scholarship, and his not-so-perfect resume and lack of community service would put that out-of reach, although he does go out of his way to help his neighbors when they're in need. Rick, who generally waits tables, has failed out of college, and he hasn't told his parents that he has found his passion: to be a chef; Jim and Sue don't really want that for either of their children, as they only opened the restaurant so they could support their family. Rick also faces the return home of his Jewish ""friend"" Sadie from Los Angeles who has always had feelings for him but has never really forgiven him for standing her up at her high-school prom because of his feelings of lack of self-worth. Jim and Sue have given Romy, an account executive at a New York furnishing company, permission to forgo working at the restaurant this Christmas season so she can spend the holidays with her boyfriend Blake and his family in Vermont, having a traditional winter Christmas as idealized in all her favorite Christmas movies. Jim and Sue have given her that permission in light of their announcement that they have sold the restaurant property and will be closing the Golden Dragon for good. Their last day will be Christmas Eve, allowing their staff to be able to enjoy Christmas for the first time. This announcement, which also funnels its way to Romy in Vermont, has profound effect on the family, the staff, and the Christmas regulars because of their current issues."

"Koi Jaane Naa is an edge of the seat roller coaster noir
narrative in the whodunit genre which turns a quaint little
hill station into a dark world where death leaps out from the
imaginative mind of a sleazy crime thriller novelist and come
alive into the real world. The film revolves around Kabir who
is a very successful author struggling with a severe case of
writer's block compounded by the guilt of ghost writing cheap
bestselling pulp fiction. He meets Suhana a damsel in distress
who is a free spirit but struggles with her own nightmares, on
the run from her own demons. They find comfort in each other
and spend time together in the quaint hill station. Kabir
finds inspiration in Suhana's innocence and acceptance of him
for who he really is and she in turn finds a friend in Kabir,
who is compassionate and understanding, someone she
desperately needs.
A simmering romance is in the offing but things turn on their head
when a relentless blackmailer is found dead in the
quaint little hill station after a public spat with the author
Kabir. A series of baffling murders soon follow and Kabir is
in the dock.
The story now takes the audience on a thrilling ride as the
needle of suspicion shifts from the obvious to the probable
and from the possible to the maybe, never allowing the
audience to ever come within a mile of the climatic unravel.
The center piece of this narrative is the ghost writer Kabir
and the beautiful and innocent Suhana. They both get sucked
into a world that seems for more dangerous than the world that
had been created by the ghost writer Kabir in his raunchy
Hindi novels. But this heady mix of intense twists and turns
and chilling murders seem pale when Zaraan Khan the vigilante
character created by Kabir in his sleazy novels makes his
appearance in a human form baffling everyone involved and
blowing every possible theory up in the air and in the process
creating a whodunit that leaves the audience enthralled.
When Suhana sees Zaraan Khan kill someone she can't believe
her own eyes. She is sucked into the dark and disturbing
world but Kabir's love helps her come out triumphs on the back
of some of his own uncommon wisdom and survival instincts."

"Miranda's Breakup Boot Camp, touted as the greatest thing in breakup therapy since sliced bread, is taking Portland, Oregon by storm, so much so that psychologist Dr. Miranda Faraday, who developed the 6-week program largely styled as a traditional boot camp, is in the process of expanding the business in order to meet demand. She developed the program in part as her own therapy to deal with the emotions surrounding her now ex-husband, Dex Finnegan, leaving her. She would also admit to herself that the boot camp is not easy; she herself broke one of her own cardinal rules when she cyberstalked Dex. Among the disparate group that has signed up for the latest camp is magazine reporter Ben Meyers, a reluctant attendee who does not inherently believe in such therapy, viewing it solely as meaningless psychological mumbo-jumbo and a fad, but is attending as a favor to support his sister, Kim, who is dealing with the discovery of her ex-husband getting engaged, and who, in attending, does truly believe in such therapy being able to ease her pain. While Ben is indeed dealing with his last girlfriend Jennifer breaking up with him, Ben, if being honest to himself, would admit that it is the breakup with former girlfriend Serena 10 years ago that has made him a broken man unable to commit. Two opposing items complicate matters between Miranda and Ben. First, they start to fall for each other, no dating between camp members one of the golden rules in the inherent issues with the rebound. That may be a moot point with the second in Ben's assignment editor Leo learning of he being in boot camp: to write an exposé on Miranda and the camp, a promotion to an editorial position and a corner office pending the resulting article."

The actual climbing took 6 months and 6 days between April 2019 to October 2019. The first person to climb the 14 Eight-Thousanders was Italian climber Reinhold Messner who took 16 years between 1970 and 1986 and completed the feat without the use of supplementary oxygen. By 2013, the feat had been achieved in 7 years and 310 days by South Korean climber Kim Chang, who also did not use supplementary oxygen. Purja decided to use oxygen above 7,500m for Project Possible based on prior experiences when not using oxygen on past Eight-Thousander climbs would have stopped him from saving the lives of stricken climbers (something he ended up doing several times during the project). In 2021, when leading a larger all-Nepali team to complete the first winter ascent of K2, Purja did not use oxygen."

Taking another look around the tiny flat, she notices red and white match heads sprinkled in the plants and on the cheese Sarah was feeding to the rats, noting that everything that has touched the white phosphorus is dead, while the more expensive red phosphorus is not nearly as volatile. Sh recalls more such experiments from the ""love nest"" in town, and the pieces come together. The white phosphorus that the match factory has been using for the past two years is toxic, and is killing the girls. To cover it up, the factory owners are blaming it on typhus. And Sarah has proof. Enola finds Tewkesbury, and asks him for his help, and to apologize for dismissing him earlier. Tewkesbury tries to assure her he has no time or interest in finding a wife, since he is kept far too busy with politics to think about anything else. Enola encourages him, and fills him in on the case. He offers any help he can give. They are once again interrupted by a knock, and Enola hides while Tewkesbury answers to find the woman from earlier, Cicely, who says she must speak with him on an urgent matter. He promises to talk later and she leaves. Worried what Enola might think, he explains that she came to confide in him about a conspiracy to do with factory laws. He tries to put his feelings for Enola into words, but she is too distracted by her thoughts to listen. She figures out that all this time, Cicely, who also went to the ball without a chaperone, is in fact Sarah Chapman in disguise. She runs outside to try and catch up, but Sarah is gone. Tewkesbury frustratedly follows, and asks if she heard anything he was saying. She did, and asks him what the fan flourish he gave her at the ball meant. He admits it meant 'I love you.' Enola remembers Cicely/Sarah giving William the same flourish at the ball, and realizes that they actually were deeply in love, working together with Mae to expose William's own father. The invited Tewkesbury to the ball because he is the only man in government they could trust to help them. Enola admits that she loves Tewkesbury as well, and asks him to help her finish the case. They go to the match factory and sneak in, where Enola runs into Sherlock, the epicenter of his case also being Lyon's Match Factory. They find William dead upstairs, seemingly killed under questioning. They discover a scrap of sheet music in his hand, matching the one Enola found on Mae, ""The Truth of the Gods"". Tewkesbury suggests that ""The Gods"" could be a reference to the upper balcony of a theater, and they rush to the Paragon. On the way, Tewkesbury asks Enola to trade his dance lesson for a fight lesson from her. She teaches him the basics, and they share a first kiss. When they make it to the theater, Sarah is there to meet them, the documents she and William stole proving Lord McIntyre and Henry Lyon conspired to hide the true cause of death among the match girls, among other evidence, hidden under the seats in the balcony. The others tell her William has been killed, but there is no time to mourn, as Grail and his men arrive with Bessie held hostage to demand the papers. Bessie fights back and gets away, and the group scatters. Enola swings on the trapeze to the stage below, but is cut off from the exit. Grail pulls a gun and shoots Sherlock in the shoulder before pursuing Enola upstairs, meanwhile Tewkesbury waylays Sargent Beeston, Grail's burly officer, but is hopelessly outmatched against the policeman hand to hand. Sherlock takes on the final two men, throwing Tewkesbury his cane sword to even the odds. Enola plays cat and mouse with Grail to make him waste his bullets, and she succeeds in protecting Sarah and Bessie by luring Grail onto the suspended catwalks high above the stage. Grail grabs a knife from the dressing rooms and follows Enola, who runs to a dead end before a long drop. Grail stabs Enola with the knife, which distracts Tewkesbury long enough for Beeston to disarm and subdue him.

The hook snags on Grail, first crushing him against the ceiling, then dropping him to the floor. Meanwhile, Tewkesbury summons all his remaining strength to deliver a single, powerful blow to Beeston while his guard is down, dropping the officer in one hit. Sherlock also manages to neutralize the other two men, and the group reunites.

She blames Grail's blunt methods for their deaths, but nevertheless she found it thrilling to play the game.

"In late 1944, the Finns make a treaty with the Soviet Union, that aggression between them will cease if they will remove their former German allies from Finland. This conflict is known as the Lapland War, and the German forces retaliate against the Finns. Retired commando and prospector Aatami Korpi lives alone with only his horse and his faithful dog in the remote wilderness of Lapland. Aatami spends his days panning and mining in search of gold. He sees battles taking place in the distance, but takes little interest in them. After uncovering a rich gold deposit, he collects a hefty amount of nuggets and mounts his horse, heading for the nearest town with his dog in tow. Along the way, Aatami encounters a 30-man Wehrmacht platoon led by ruthless SS Obersturmführer Bruno Helldorf and his subordinate Wolf, who are destroying settlements in their retreat and have taken several Finnish women captive. Helldorf takes little interest in Aatami, letting him pass. Aatami is soon accosted by a second group of soldiers who discover his saddlebags full of gold and prepare to execute him and his dog, but he swiftly kills them all. Alerted by the gunfire, Bruno investigates and discovers the carnage. He finds one of Aatami's gold nuggets, taken by one of the dying soldiers. Bruno and his tank pursue Aatami to the edge of a minefield, where Aatami's horse is killed by a landmine. Gathering up his gold, Aatami intentionally detonates another mine to make his escape. The soldiers sent after him are quickly claimed by the minefield. Two of the captive women are ordered ahead to ensure a clear path. One of the captives, Aino, volunteers to take the place of one of the women and leads the way. Retrieving Aatami's dog tag, Bruno learns that he was once a Finnish commando who lost his family and home fighting against the Red Army during the Winter War. Left with nothing, the vengeful Aatami became a legendary ""one-man death squad"" nicknamed Koschei, the ""Immortal"", who has killed hundreds of Communist troops. Bruno ignores the warning, defying orders to turn around and cease following Aatami. Wounded and exhausted, Aatami is awakened by the platoon's approach. With the soldiers' dogs on his trail, he hangs underneath one of the German vehicles and punctures the fuel tank, dousing himself in gasoline to hide his scent. When the platoon halts to inspect the leak, Aatami flees, holding the dogs at bay by lighting himself on fire before diving into a nearby lake. Waiting for him to surface, Bruno sends soldiers into the lake, but Aatami slits their throats underwater and breathes in the escaping air from their necks. Aatami reaches the other side of the lake, but Bruno finds his dog. Aatami discovers the town has been left in burning ruins by the Germans, and takes shelter in a petrol station. Bruno sends Aatami's dog to find his master, with a lit dynamite stick attached to his collar. Aatami saves the dog but is subdued by the explosion. Bruno, Wolf, and tank driver Schütze hang Aatami from the petrol station's sign, taking the gold and leaving him for dead, but Aatami hooks his wounds onto a protruding reinforcement bar, saving him from the noose but rendering him unconscious and still hanging from the rope. A pair of German pilots land in search of fuel and the wind from the plane loosens the petrol station's sign and cause Aatami to fall to the ground. The engineer in the plane notices Aatami is alive and the pilot orders him to kill Aatami and the dog. Aatami manages to kill the engineer and knocks the pilot unconscious. Unwilling to face the consequences of Germany's impending defeat, Bruno intends to use the gold to escape with Wolf and Schütze, arranging for a pilot to fly them to safety while the rest of the platoon makes their way to Norway. Meanwhile, Aatami forces the surviving pilot to fly him towards the platoon. Soon, the soldiers discover the airplane crashed in their path, with the pilot hanged by the same noose Wolf used on Aatami. As the convoy continues, Aatami climbs onto the truck holding the captured women, kills their guards, and arms the women. He and Aino commandeer one of the trucks, allowing him to leap onto Bruno's tank while the women gun down the rest of the soldiers in the other truck. Pulling Wolf out of the tank and beating him badly, Aatami leaves him at the mercy of the women and follows Bruno, who callously kills Schütze before taking off with the pilot. Aatami fires on the plane, mortally wounding the pilot, and uses his pickax to hack his way on-board in midair. After engaging in hand-to-hand combat, Bruno beats Aatami with a static line, subduing him. As Bruno is about to hit him again, Aatami swiftly hooks the static line to a bomb and releases the bomb through the bomb-bay door, dropping Bruno to his death. Finding the pilot also dead, Aatami straps himself in as the plane crashes into a large swamp. Led by Aino, the women deliver Wolf and the German tank to an incredulous Finnish unit. Remarkably still alive, Aatami crawls out of the swamp, reunites with his dog, and makes his way to war-ravaged Helsinki. Bloody and battered, Aatami enters a bank where he dumps his gold nuggets on the counter. The other customers are smartly dressed and look at him in wonderment. He finally speaks for the first time in the movie, asking the teller to exchange them for large bank notes, explaining they will not be as heavy to carry as the nuggets have been."

The two have not spoken since, subsequent actions having fractured their relationship even more. While Steve has managed to eke out a solo career with moderate success solely on the strength of goodwill toward the duo, Mike has retreated from the world in those issues that led to that on-stage incident--that is until now, as he has agreed to a televised Christmas reunion show called ""Bedford and Sullivan at Big Red"", Big Red being the Sullivan family home in the small town of Pineville. Talent manager Dianne Carter, who represents neither Bedford or Sullivan but who has some stake in the show, is asked by the show's producer Troy for assistance, especially in dealing with Mike, who is largely missing-in-action although he agreed to do the show. Of all the agents in Dianne's agency, she assigns Quinn Allen to the task, for a reason which Quinn believed she had kept secret: that Quinn is Mike Sullivan's estranged daughter. Quinn doesn't want to deal with her father, and she is able to negotiate a deal with Dianne as she reluctantly accepts the assignment. When she heads back to Pineville, she learns that Steve is currently represented by his son Jason Bedford, her childhood friend--who, she believes, exacerbated the problems between their fathers in the intervening years. In reconnecting with her father, Quinn learns that both he and Steve need this show to happen for different reasons as Quinn, Jason, Steve, and Mike negotiate and renegotiate, the latter especially around Bedford and Sullivan performing arguably their biggest hit for the show, ""One December Night,"" a very personal song for Mike, one that has some very painful memories. In the process, Quinn and Jason start to fall for each other, but the road to their happily-ever-after might depend on what happens with the show."

"Chris Winnacker, the CEO and co-founder of CJ Toys, has wanted to be a toy-maker since she was ten. Her focus the last several years has been to expand the business, in the process she having lost the spirit of toys and Christmas, despite Christmas being her complete given name. She believes she's gotten what she wished for when, a few weeks before Christmas, she is approached by Kathleen Keller, CEO of the much larger Arlo Toys, who, upon Kathleen's imminent retirement, proposes a merger between the two companies with Chris as the CEO of the new company all pending approval by the Arlo board. The one technicality is that Kathleen requires the contract to be signed by CJ's other co-founder and CEO, Joe Sullivan, the ""J"" in CJ. The problem for Chris is that Joe walked out on her and the business seven years ago, the two who have not spoken since and his whereabouts unknown. She is also unaware the reason he left was that he believed she had lost the spirit of what made them start the business together, that spirit which was present when they made and sold their first toys together as children. She is able to track him down, he working at his father Tucker Sullivan's antiques and collectibles store focusing on the musical and toy collectibles in their sale and repair, this job until he figures out his next move whenever his father sells the business. Initially refusing to provide his consent for the merger in it not being his vision for CJ, Joe does eventually provide at least a verbal consent in return for Chris volunteering her time to help in a Christmas fundraiser he organizes, the Christmas Toy Drive Jamboree, culminating with the jamboree on December 23rd. Without telling her, Joe is hoping that Chris, in volunteering her time, regains the spirit that made them start CJ Toys together in the first place. He is also doing it in that he has secretly been in love with her since they were ten. While there has been that unspoken feeling on Chris' side all these years as well, the question then becomes whether they can bridge the gap on the professional and emotional side of the equation for that romantic side to take root, not being able to achieve the former which will probably lead to them once again going their separate ways despite neither truly wanting that to happen."

This year, they outsourced the organization of the toy giveaway to a professional fundraising company, which unexpectedly went bankrupt, taking with them all the donations for the toys; this information has not yet reached the media.

Before Uhtred leaves, Ingrith prophesies that ""seven kings must die"" before England is to be united. Uhtred reaches Aegelesburg, where Aelfweard prepares to defend against Aethelstan's impending attack. Aethelstan and his advisor Ingilmundr soon arrive and thwart a trap set by Aelfweard. Uhtred convinces Aelfweard to surrender peacefully, but Aethelstan swiftly kills him and massacres his men. Aethelstan is crowned king of the Saxons and Ingilmundr, who is secretly Aethelstan's lover, urges him to fulfill his grandfather's dream of uniting England and all Christians. In Eoferwic, Aethelstan has taken over following the death of the previous Northumbrian king Rognvaldr and demands that all foreign kings pay him tribute or face conquest and forced baptism. Uhtred arrives and witnesses the destruction of Pagan monuments before learning that King Hywel Dda has submitted to Aethelstan after his son is taken hostage. Uhtred then discovers Aethelstan's relationship with Ingilmundr and believes he's being deceived.

Ingilmundr later convinces a servant to lure Uhtred into a trap, where he is captured by Aethelstan's men, forcing Osbert to surrender Bebbanburg. Osbert and Edmund are taken captive and sent to Thelwael while Aethelstan, unable to kill Uhtred, banishes him from England. On the Isle of Man, Anlaf hosts a gathering of kings with Prince Domnal and the rulers of Strathclyde, Orkney, Shetland, and Man, warning them of Aethelstan's impending conquest. Although they initially decline the offer of allying with a Pagan, Aethelstan embarks upon an invasion of Scotland, forcing King Constantin and the other rulers to form an alliance.

A remorseful Aethelstan makes peace with Uhtred and plans to stop Anlaf's invasion but refuses any help. Knowing that Aethelstan will likely die, Uhtred and his allies head to face Anlaf, who has amassed his forces at Brunanburh. At the Battle of Brunanburh, Uhtred and Aethelstan's forces are heavily outnumbered and make a tactical withdrawal allowing Saxon cavalry to flank from behind and in the chaos, Domnal and the heirs of the other kings are killed.

In the aftermath of the battle, the other kings quickly abandon Anlaf and captive Ingilmundr is executed.

Uhtred agrees to swear Northumbria to Aethelstan in exchange for him agreeing to make Edmund his sole heir, making Aethelstan the first king of a united England, fulfilling the dream of his grandfather King Alfred.

In the approach to Christmas, they are both at a crossroads in life. Joy has returned home to Columbus having graduated earlier than expected with a Masters degree in Nursing.

She is physically all right, with only a mild concussion and minor scrapes and bruises, but she awakens with a case of retrograde amnesia, which is problematic because nobody in town knows who she is and any identification she had was lost, probably somewhere in the river.

After a week with no further idea who she is, ""Jane"", as she is now called, decides to check herself out of the hospital against the advice of Sheriff Crowley and Doctor Grant, her attending physician, believing that the answers to her life await her in the form of ""Mark"" at that tree-lighting in Charleston on Christmas Eve.

"Ali Reed owns and operates Monarch Salon in small town Golden Peak, ID, it largely a family affair with her college student sister, Chelsea Bowden, doing most jobs in the salon in wanting to be self-sufficient to pay for her education, and their mother, Carol Bowden, working the reception desk. The salon is at one of its busiest times of the year coinciding with the annual Miss Golden Peak Beauty Pageant - Ali a former Miss Golden Peak herself - it organized with an iron fist for the past twenty years by Mitzi Stewart. Police Chief Fred Wright has long relied unofficially on Ali's insight to solve cases, both due to most people passing through the salon at one time or another and Ali being their confidante, and Ali having a special perception of people in general. Fred may have to rely on Ali again when a murder occurs in broad daylight on site at the event venue of someone associated to the pageant. The last murder that took place in town happened two years ago, that victim, Ali's husband Detective Dan Reed, murdered while on duty, this latest unofficial request by Fred for Ali to keep her eyes open bringing up some painful memories of Dan. While someone is behind bars for Dan's murder, Ali has a feeling that they have the wrong person, that thought which keeps her up at night, and has prevented her from moving on, she finally accepting an offer for ""non-date"" drinks with horticulturalist Sterling Addison that first baby step in trying to move on. This latest unofficial request also does not sit well with Detective Kyle Crawford, recently moved to Golden Peak from Columbus, he leading the investigation. While Fred only rules out Ali as the murderer, he and Kyle cannot rule out anyone else on site at the time and/or people associated to the pageant, including vendors such as the staff of Monarch who are doing hair and makeup for the contestants, many who had a strained relationship with the ""difficult"" victim. Chelsea is viewed doubly by Kyle in she reluctantly having agreed to enter the pageant itself, solely as a possible means to pay for her tuition. As such, Ali continues to butt heads with both Kyle, who cannot rule out people like Chelsea unless evidence proves otherwise, and her mother, who does not like how Ali gets involved in crime investigations. Carol may have reason to worry as if Ali gets too close to discovering the identity of the murderer, she may unwittingly place a target on her back."

reality check however has a different answer. Today, when one walks out of the walls of his/her
home, there is no guarantee of returning safely. Monsters disguised in the form of human beings
continue to harass and prey on the innocents. This is the story of two such individuals. The story of
a couple who set out on a long drive towards an unknown destination, only to face unforeseen
dangers that turn their romantic drive into a nightmare.
Meet Arjun, a cheerful youngster who is head over heels in love with Jaanu. He picks up Janaki, a
doctor by profession and heads out on a long drive. On the road, the two share tender moments of
love, affection, and concern for each other. As the sun sets and the two stop for a break on a deserted
road, an intimate moment brews between them. Just when it seems like life couldn't have been
better for the two, fate has other plans for them.
When the two are about to share a kiss, a flashlight hits their face. The two turn to discover a burly
man with an evil smile pointing a mobile phone at them. Jaanu is terrified and hides for safety
behind Arjun. He too is rendered helpless against the stranger who is out to destroy their lives. The
man named Mani who's out to torment the two begins to threaten to strip the couple of their
dignity by leaking the video for the world to see. Jaanu is petrified and Arjun can't do anything but
beg Mani to let them both go.
Mani corners the hapless couple with no option but to heed to his demands. Jaanu pleads Arjun to
get her out of this traumatic night. With no other solution in sight, Arjun realizes that he could pay
his way out of the nightmare. He convinces Mani that he would pay for their freedom and takes out
his mobile phone, but as luck would have it, Arjun realizes that his phone right in the need of the
hour, is dead. Arjun begs Mani that he will pay him back once he gets home but the stranger is in no
mood to listen.
Horror awaits the couple as Mani makes it worse by demanding that Arjun drive him to his place of
choice and pay for the night. Throughout the drive, Mani harasses poor Jaanu by taunting her
physically and torturing her mentally. Enroute, Mani picks up a drunkard and makes Arjun pay for
the booze. In the end, the dreadful journey comes to an end as they reach a deserted estate, leaving
Jaanu and Arjun even more petrified.
To make it worse, Mani invites his friend over to join the 'party' and he too adds to the couple's
worries. Arjun finds a charging spot at the farmhouse and pays Mani, crawling his way out of the
horrific night. The traumatic night destroys the relationship of the lovebirds. Watching the love of his
life leave him for not being able to protect her, Arjun decides to avenge the humiliation and
harrowing time he faced.
What follows is a classic tale of revenge and retaliation where Arjun plays the tricks of the devil to
teach the monsters a lesson that they're not ready for. Long Drive deals with the perils of life that
could turn a great day into a traumatic one through the eyes of an innocent couple. It also deals with

"Maid in Malacañang depicts the other side of the historic bloodless ""EDSA Revolution"" in the Philippines in 1986. The reaction of the Marcos family to the betrayals of their allies and the opposition to their rule during the three-day saga was presented through the eyes of their loyal yet very disciplined household personnel (Karla Estrada, Elizabeth Oropresa, and Beverly Salviejo portray the real-life Marcos maids Crisanta, Lucy, and Biday). The movie humanizes the demonized Marcoses, specially Ferdinand and Imelda (Cesar Montano and Ruffa Gutierrez) on how they express their love for their children, how they treat their household and how they run the government. The film pushes the viewers on the necessity to analyze the unfolding of events right before their eyes. It provokes a discussion and leaves the viewers to make their own conclusions as they correlate the stories of the Marcos loyalists' story with the Marcos antagonists and the Philippines' situation today. It triggers so many questions and attempts to provide possible answers as to why the Marcos children Imee (Cristine Reyes), Bongbong (Diego Loyzaga) and Irene (Ella Cruz) maintain their love and devotion to their parents, specially to their father, and how millions of Filipinos maintain their loyalty to the Marcoses. The 1986 EDSA was bloodless because of the Marcoses as well? Kudos to Writer and Director Darrel Yap for this creation that brought the Filipinos back in the cinemas."

"It all originated from the ideas of Fernando Araujo, a man living his best years around 2003, as he had found his vocation as an artist. Araujo himself explains the arts he was interested in at that time-plastic arts, martial arts, and cannabis arts. Simultaneously creating art with plastic, practicing martial arts, and growing marijuana in an indoor farm, the man suddenly realized that there was something else he wanted to do, something greater-he wanted to rob a bank.
Araujo quickly acted on his plan and set his target to be a two-story branch of Banco Rio in San Isidro, an affluent part of Buenos Aires. Thinking of digging a tunnel below the building, which would then easily lead to the underground vaults, Araujo discovered an already existing sewer tunnel that could be used to do the same.
Next, he needed to find a way to build further sections in the tunnel to reach and then break into the bank from underground. Araujo admits that he wanted to conduct the robbery in a manner he finds artistic, making use of skills and not force, without hurting anyone involved, and for this, he gathered a very selective crew.
First was Araujo's old friend, Sebastian Bolster, who ran a jet ski workshop and had enough expertise in practical engineering. Bolster says that convincing him was not difficult, as his own family had been tremendously hurt financially, much like many other Argentinians, by the unstable conditions of Argentina's banking system. Together with Araujo, Bolster mapped out the entire sewer tunnel underneath San Isidro, calculating its path towards the bank building and also constructing makeshift chambers to break into it.
But as Araujo worked meticulously on how to avoid triggering the motion-sensor alarms in the vaults, the sense of the impossibility of the whole plan struck him, until he was struck with a grander plan, of course. Till now, his idea was that they would get into the underground vaults at a time when the bank would be closed, via the tunnel, and leave the same way, but this would immediately get them caught because of the alarms. Instead, he now decided to combine two separate ideas into one-they would enter the bank through the doorway, making it look like a normal bank robbery, take hostages and buy themselves time, get to the underground vaults from the inside, and then escape through the tunnel with all the money."

"Detective Travis Hurley arrives in a small town in the Australian outback. The Hotel Limbo, which resembles a rocky grotto, proves to be perfect for his very own particular type of relaxation. But he has come here to investigate a case from 20 years ago for which the only evidence is a number of tape recordings: the unsolved murder of an Aboriginal girl named Charlotte Hayes. The residents are less than forthcoming regarding the provision of information; this is especially true of the victim's fractured family. You do not talk to a cop, especially if he is white. But Hurley, in a stoic performance by Simon Baker, knows how to wend his way in his cool car through the labyrinthine landscape of the Opal Mountains and form a bond with the cave and caravan dwellers. Indigenous Australian film director Ivan Sen is renowned for his depiction of magnificent screen landscapes. In Limbo, he juxtaposes the low sky with the mounds above and holes below ground around the opal-mining capital of Coober Pedy. The result is a serene ""desert noir"" that is as convincing as a detective story as it is a subtle portrait of the First Nation's deep-seated experiences of everyday racism. A genre film suffused with bleak nostalgia."

"Other red flags concerning Wirecard also started to show up when a short seller was preparing an investigative piece on the company. After initial reports of the company allowing payments for illegal gambling in the US, it was found that all transactions in the US were facilitated by a company in the UK, and the mentioned address of this company happened to be just a small random house in the English countryside. The resident of this house claimed that a few individuals had offered him a monthly payment only for signing some papers and then posting some letters.
The 2nd report was prepared by short sellers called Zatarra, who met Dan and shared all of their information with Dan and convinced him that Wirecard was laundry money for criminals. The short sellers published their report.
After this second article had been prepared, Dan McCrum made mention of it and its contents in an online post, and this itself made Wirecard react through a letter sent by their lawyer to the Financial Times. They had made claims of their own that McCrum was working with short-sellers for his own financial gain. McCrum also felt that he was suddenly being followed around, and a person spying around the Financial Times office was also spotted.
Short sellers did not have a good reputation as they were seen as destroying jobs. The market didn't believe the Zatarra report, as the evidence was not found to be comprehensive enough.
One of the short sellers was even manhandled by goons sent by Wirecard."

That change of hands coincides with their neighbor, Andres Fernandez, also retiring and selling his property, the Holden family's long term plan always to purchase the property as it belonged to them thirty years ago when they had to sell during one of those hard times.

"An old man in a wheelchair listens to radio news announcements of a heat wave across Germany. A young nurse arrives at his house to find the door is unlocked, and the man is missing. As she tries looking for him he appears and kills her. Text appears telling the viewer that a long time ago, old people were thought to have an avenging spirit in some of them, which would take full control of the weakest members and drive them into a seemingly blind rage against the world. We meet main character Ella as she drives along with her two children Laura, and Noah on their way to the marriage ceremony of Ella's sister Sanna. Ella had divorced her husband Lucas resulting in an argument with her father, Aike. Lucas is now involved with a woman named Kim having stayed in the countryside. Sanna informs Ella and the kids that Aike has been put up at the local retirement house since she left. Ella decides to go there and bring their father back for the night's celebrations, and they take Noah along.
The retirement home appears derelict and less than hygienic; various residents sit around desolately. They meet Lucas' new partner, Kim, who works there. As Ella tells Aike that they are here to take him home for the wedding, young Noah sees one of the other residents, an old man, staring at them. That evening, the same man rallies all the other old people to kill the orderlies in the retirement home before they leave en masse, heading into the night. After the wedding, Kim and Lucas spot an old man from the retirement home out in an open field, as well as a number of cars stopped on the road with dead people inside. Lucas drives his car back to the country house, where attacks had already begun. Many guests are killed including the newlywed couple.
The noise of the attacks wake Ella up, who is unaware of the full breadth of the situation. Ella finds Sanna and her husband dead, and she herself has to jump out of the window to escape a horde of old people. She realizes she can't find Noah or Aike, so her, Lucas, and Kim all search for the pair. Eventually he is found in the attic, and tells everyone his grandfather had told him to hide there before joining the horde himself. The old people harm and kill everyone who has somehow broken families or expressed their doubts about love, further playing into the idea that it's all a result of a curse. Kim intentionally puts Laura into harms way as a result of her insecurity over Lucas' love for her vs his kids, and while Laura is able to survive, Kim also manages to push Ella out of the house and lock the door behind her. The old people attack Ella, as her children and Lucas try frantically to save her, which leads to Kim sacrificing herself, either out of guilt, despair, or love for Lucas.
Thanks to her distraction, Ella is able to get away, and back inside the house. To escape from the old people attempting to break into the house, they use an old tunnel that leads to a nearby cabin. During the escape attempt, both Ella and Lucas are killed, managing to protect their children as they do so. On the other side of the tunnel, Laura and Noah discover it is now daylight, and their phones work again. Laura calls Alex, a boy she was shown to be romantic with, and instructs him to meet them at the beach with his boat. Before they can escape, they encounter their grandfather Aike. She points a gun at him but before she can do anything the leader of the old people tries to kill her. Facing death, she tries to sing their family song, and Noah joins her. The curse is weakened by this display of love, and Aike manages to get the gun and shoot the leader. This is what happens here, and ultimately, Aike takes up the gun and kills the leader. The kids and Aike all go to the beach together where Alex is waiting on a boat."

"On May 9, 2017, Reality Winner watches Fox News coverage on the firing of James Comey by President Donald Trump on the TV at her office. 25 days later, on June 3, Winner returns home from grocery shopping where she is confronted by FBI agents Taylor and Garrick, who explain they have a warrant to search her house and her belongings. As a team of agents arrive and begin searching the house, Winner engages in casual conversation with the agents, all of which is picked up by recording device, the transcript of which forms the basis of the film's dialogue. During the early portion of the recording, Winner expresses concern for her pet dog and cat's safety during the search. Winner agrees to speak with Taylor and Garrick in an empty, disused bedroom in her house. Garrick and Taylor start to question Winner asking about the specifics of her work. She explains, besides working as a yoga instructor and CrossFit trainer, she is a Farsi translator for a government contractor and is hoping to be deployed to Afghanistan as a translator so her fluency in Pashto can be better utilized. The agents eventually reveal they are questioning Winner regarding the recent leak of classified government documents to an online publication. Winner initially denies knowledge, but over the course of an hour is eventually compelled to confess she printed and leaked a document from the National Security Agency's database. The film initially redacts specifics of the leak, as is done in the transcript, but eventually it is revealed that the documents revealed proof of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and the publication was The Intercept, which had put out a call for evidence of Russian interference. Winner denies wishing to be a whistle-blower or undermine the intelligence community à la Edward Snowden, instead expressing she wished for the American public to have the same information the government had regarding the election. As the interrogation wraps up, she chiefly expresses concern for her pets as she realizes she will be taken into custody. She is escorted out of her house and handcuffed, as footage is shown of media reports regarding the leak. Winner receives both praise and criticism for her actions, with some accusing her of colluding with the Middle East or denying the veracity of the leaks altogether. Some outlets criticize The Intercept for allowing the leak to be traced back to Winner, and others theorize that Winner's punishment was designed to discourage potential whistle-blowers. A textual epilogue explains that Winner was denied bail and charged under the Espionage Act. She spent four years in jail and will remain on supervised release until November 2024. It notes that the same document Winner leaked was later used on Senate floor as evidence of Russian interference."

Johnson, founded STAR - Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries) helped lead the community to band together to demand their rights. Building bridges across generations of trans sex workers, a civil rights movement was born."

The air cargo section of the D-company collapsed with the deaths of Desai and Ibrahim. He wanted to terrorize Mumbai for daring to take a step against him and for the large-scale murder of Muslims that the country had recently witnessed.
He orchestrated the Mumbai blast-a series of blasts that took the city by storm. The first bombing occurred at the Bombay Stock Exchange, which resulted in the deaths of 70 people, and gradually the news of twelve other blasts all across Mumbai was reported. Dawood wanted Mumbai to pay attention to him; bombing the city was his way of declaring that if anyone dared mess with him or his people, he would destroy the city. Dawood was no longer a high-profile gangster; he was a terrorist whose vengeance knew no boundaries. He had declared war on the State, and the police wanted to take action to reaffirm their power and position.
Police Commissioner R. D. Tyagi gave the police unlimited power to conduct as many encounters as necessary to reinstall fear in the gangsters.

"Carrying on the legacy of her deceased Belgian paternal grandfather, Lucy Sweet is the master chocolatier at How Sweet It Is in the Midwestern town of Watson Corners, the store which she owns and operates with her widowed mother, Helen Sweet. In this new year, they are facing a massive rent increase, which they can only cover by increased business in what is their busy season in the lead up to Valentine's Day or risk closing altogether. In the unwitting help of Lucy's best friend Serena and their new employee Georgie, whose social media posts are increasing the shop's exposure, Lucy and Helen believe the way out of their financial predicament is the chocolate cupid, a confection which was originally only given/sold to friends and family in the legend that eating it will lead to true love for those whose hearts are open to it. Lucy had long created a wall in the shop featuring the many couples who attest to their love happening after eating the cupid, one being Helen herself and her now deceased husband, Scott Sweet. Helping or hindering that exposure is the arrival of reporter Dean Chase of Channel 55 News, who was given the assignment of covering the legend of chocolate cupid by the station's news director, Nora Nguyen. The issue with Dean is that he is renowned for his no holds barred exposés, he only given this assignment by Nora to help him show the network brass that he's not a one trick pony in being considered for a job he really wants as a news anchor for their Chicago affiliate's morning show. Dean's initial inclination is to call out the fraud that is the cupid in he truly believing it to be such, he changing his tune if only in the goal of the promotion. All this added exposure does the trick of the needed increased revenue, with the question being whether Dean is converted as he and Lucy spend time together and start to fall for each other. This item may be tested as Nora wants this extended assignment to culminate on Valentine's Day with Dean eating a cupid on camera, a long term arrangement with Lucy which may be incompatible with his professional end goal of a job in New York City. It may also test Lucy's commitment as she admits to never have eaten a cupid herself not so much in fearing love, but what comes after love, namely pain and heartbreak as witnessed by the extreme grief experienced by Helen when Scott died."

"The film opens with an old film reel detailing Helix Industries new 'Respawn machine'. The film shows the results of some of the subjects respawning as results turn variably worse, with one subject having respawned with Gouged out eyes. The film then cuts to the title and begins with the date of Thursday, October 31, 1968 at 7:57 PM. The camera pans down a set of stairs towards a room with a door labeled 'MEDICAL'. There is an eerie blue light and inside is the BLU team medic, Dr. Fritz Ludwig. Dr. Ludwig appears to be having a nightmare/flashback/premonition as he lay twitching in his desk chair, with shots cutting to a scene of a dump truck pouring bodies of dead Mercs into a cavity of water, where it is later shown to be the sewers of 2Fort. At the end of the tunnel a masked individual is seen staring at the viewer as the shot then cuts to the respawn room door opening as only blood pours out from the room, before Dr. Ludwig wakes up. As he looks around the formerly blue lighting in his office has turned red and a masked figure slowly approaches his office door. He comes through the door as black tentacles wrap around the door frame behind him, and slowly around the ceiling reaching the back wall. The figures arm outstretches towards Dr. Ludwigs neck as his shadow grows larger and closer before Dr Ludwig suddenly finds himself awake, catching his breath as the BLU scout knocks and opens his office door. The scout asks Dr. Ludwig if he's ever had bad dreams. The camera then pans to the Dr. grabbing his glasses, showing a newspaper article saying Jules Archibald has been kidnapped, the BLU executive. The camera pans to show a framed photo of the Medic (Dr. Ludwig) and Scout, and a television News Channel talking about the disappearance. The Scout during an examination then begins to tell Dr Ludwig about his dream, how at night when he was brushing his teeth, all his teeth fell out into the basin and left it bloody. He then asks the Medic if ever feels like he's being watched, to which he elaborates he felt someone was watching him through the window. Dr. Ludwig tries to reassure the Scout by saying how it was probably just someone passing by on the street, to which Scout explains he was on the second floor. Dr. Ludwig remarks that it is pry just in his head. Dr. Ludwig helps the scout up and off the exam bed as it's revealed Scout was laid off from BLU and that he ''plans to sue the hell out of them for what they did to me."" As they're leaving, a box of VHS tapes falls over. Unbeknownst to Dr. Ludwig, the Scout takes a tape labeled 'M' dated 1931, and the two leave. The title for Chapter one then displays, labeled 'The Graveyard shift'. The scene opens to BLU soldier sitting in a car in the rain. He glances out his car window to a billboard advertising Jules Archibald's re-election campaign as governor of New Mexico. Glancing back down, he notices a shadowy figure watching him. He withdraws a revolver from the glovebox and continues staring back at the figure until his partner, the BLU spy, opens the door and asks him what he is doing. After glancing away from Spy back to where the figure was, he is gone. The spy and soldier have been trying to track down the Heavy to get answers about the disappearance of Archibald. Spy takes the revolver from Soldier and after some conversation tells him to wait in the car. The heavy is seen waiting in an alley with a black briefcase checking his watch. The BLU spy uncloaks from behind him and holds the heavy at gunpoint. The Spy questions Heavy about the contents of the briefcase to which Heavy responds it isn't of his concern. After demanding the briefcase, Heavy assaults Spy, knocking him down. As the two begin to fight in the alley, the camera cuts back to Soldier sitting in the car listening to the police radio. The radio reports a fight of 3 in the local cemetery, with the suspect vehicle being a black hearse. As the two voices on the radio banter, Soldier laughs unintentionally revealing he was listening and turns the radio off. The Heavy and Spy continue to fight in the alley while Soldier smokes his cigarette outside the car. The black hearse mentioned on the radio drives past and parks a little ways down the road from him. Cutting back to the fight between Spy and Heavy, Soldier appears behind Heavy and cocks the revolver, before shooting Heavy killing him much to Spy's anger as Heavy was their only lead. Spy orders the Soldier to go back to the car and wait for him. As spy stands looking over the briefcase, he is knocked down by the mysterious figure from the opening of the film, who holds him at gunpoint. Before he fully presses the trigger the figure takes off in the Hearse with the briefcase as Soldier returns, snapping a photograph just as the vehicle drives away. The next chapter then begins, titled ""Dinner's ready!"""

In her work which is her life, she, single, travels the world on solo adventures. While she has a small but dedicated following, she will have to expand her brand when Icon merges with the more upscale Lady Day London to become Lady Icon. Rae balks at the first assignment she is given by her editor, Shelley Stevens: the Marata, a luxury underwater resort in the Maldives. The resort itself is already outside of Rae's general ""roughing it"" mentality, but she has to find a story within this setting to appeal to that broader upscale market, one that Shelley wants to be more personal, Rae failing which may mean the end of her column. At the resort, her primary liaison is Jared Joseph, the Experience Director. While Jared tries to steer her more in the direction of a new program he is developing called Clarity and Connection Yoga Meditation, Rae is more excited by the notion of the legend of the Vakkankurun, the legend being it a cargo ship that sunk one hundred years ago carrying treasures back to England, it never found. That legend also posits that it moves with every monsoon season. As Rae and Jared spend time together in trying to find the right item for her column, and as Rae spends time with fellow guest Debra Hoffman, arguable Lady Icon's demographic in she taking this trip as an adventure in trying to get on with her life following being widowed five years ago, Rae and Jared start to fall for each other. Beyond the logistics of living in two different worlds, whether there is a path to a future for Rae and Jared together may depend on the story Rae submits to Shelley, with Rae's job on the line if it doesn't meet Shelley's approval."

"Vanessa Doyle is transitioning her professional life from being a wedding planner to creating/managing a so-far fledgling compendium of all things wedding in the US called Tying the Knot. Her major promotion is a contest to plan a wedding for the winning couple to their specification using the information listed in Tying the Knot. Vanessa thinks the major problem she will be facing is that the couple have requested the wedding in five weeks time to accommodate the groom Scott Bishop's next military assignment overseas, but the bigger problem ends up being the venue they choose, the Wedding Cottage in Stony Bridge, VT, where the graduate student bride Amy Price's parents and grandparents both got married. The problem is is that Vanessa did not vet the research work done as the Cottage has been closed for five years upon the passing of the owner/operators. Vanessa learns that the current owner, Evan Stanford, the former owners' grandson, has just moved onto the property living in the annex. And while Vanessa is not quite at the level of developers as Evan has no intention of selling, she is only one rung below in terms of annoyances as he, a successful New York sculptor with a major case of artistic block, has come to Stony Bridge solely to regain his creative juices in preparation for a show for which he is required to produce one new piece. Even if Vanessa is able to convince Evan to let her use the Cottage for the wedding, she still has to be able to get it from its current run down shape to wedding ready in five weeks, all without letting Amy and Scott know what's going on. In spending time together, Vanessa and Evan start to fall for each other. A potential obstacle for a relationship between them is if Evan believes she is only trying to get close to him for her own professional gain, both for this wedding, it not coming off meaning her business before it even gets off the ground, and in the long run in playing off his fame."

"Dr. Hawass takes his inspiration from English archaeologist Howard Carter. It took Carter five years to find the tomb of Tutankhamun. Carter's journey taught him to be patient and to never give up on his vision. Soon his team was able to confirm that the tomb had remained sealed and, therefore, untouched for over four thousand years, and a sarcophagus was discovered. Upon removing the stone cover, a skeleton was found. Since the process of mummification was not advanced during the Old Kingdom, the skeleton was deformed. Dr. Hawass decided to leave the coffin as it was since the body was already damaged. The final month of excavation was challenging for Dr. Hawass's team, but the spirit was high, and the thought of uncovering an important fragment of history kept them going. Another sarcophagus was found; it was sealed and enormous in size. The coffin belonged to a woman named Nebet Hut, and the body was stored over 4,300 years ago. The body was well preserved, and her ornaments retained their blue-green colors even after remaining sealed for thousands of years."
"The next marvel in focus is MIT's Improbable AI Lab, which has been trying to implement AI autonomy for robotic dogs. While the robot dogs were first designed to walk and function by themselves, the particular project that is shown in this documentary film covers teaching the AI to learn on its own as well. The main idea for the robot dog to be put to practical use is to send it to remote locations and provide information or support, especially to disaster-hit areas or places of such crises. But in order to do so, the robot dog must be able to walk on and traverse a number of different terrains, which can be rocky, slippery, and unusual in other ways as well. To enable such a technology, the Improbable AI Lab has been developing an autonomous robot dog that can register the terrain it is walking on and immediately adapt to it, all without any need for human intervention. Killer Robots also features a brief presentation of this experiment, as the robot dog is made to walk on a soft sponge floor, rough terrain with debris littered around it, and then an extremely slippery surface coated with oil. The robot indeed manages to understand and adapt its style of movement after a series of iterations."
"In Israel, Berger and his team were talking about a time period much earlier. Berger, after consulting with his team and finding evidence to support his claims, made it public that the Naledi indulged in ritualistic practices, especially when it came to disposing of their dead, and what they had found was not merely a bed of bones but an actual grave.
As soon as the findings were made public, other experts and scientists discarded the speculations of Berger's team as superfluous, but those who were in the Rising Star cave system knew that with time, the world would have to accept what they were saying, considering that the evidence was way too compelling, and the speculations were not as baseless as the people believed them to be.
The critics said that the Naledi brain was too small to engage in rituals like burials. Maybe the humans buried them there as a pet chamber.
Burying the dead was an activity that signified that Homo Naledi didn't want the corpses of their own to be devoured by other animals, and it also determined their social and religious attitudes. Probably they also performed some kind of ritual during the burial, and all these things told us that they not only cared for their own but also felt a sense of loss when any member passed away.
The team also found evidence of a fire used to cook food inside the Dragon's Back chamber. The caves were pitch dark and fire was needed even to see things and where they were going.
The team recreates how the Naledi would carry the body of the dead into the Dinaledi chamber. It was probably a group activity, requiring coordination, fire and tools to dig the holes. Love was a possible motivator to burying the dead bodies. As else, it would be fed on by animals, insects and vultures.
If Homo Naledi were burying their dead thousands of years before the humans, then what does it even mean to be a human."
"After the Big Bang some 13.8 billion years ago, the universe was filled with hydrogen and helium gases, which eventually started to bond together, forming stars. These stars are then believed to have grouped into galaxies in a phenomenon that is termed the ""first light"" in space astronomy. It is believed that the beginning of life, in a sense, took place after this very phenomenon, and there has been a constant interest in knowing more about it. This is theoretically possible with the help of space telescopes, as they can be thought of as a means to know the past. It is based on the principle that light takes time to travel through space. Therefore, the images that we see through a space telescope of planets and galaxies many light-years away from the Earth are actually from the time that has already passed, i.e., images from the past. Although witnessing the ""first light"" still remains a theoretical possibility and is the ultimate goal of these studies, the advancement in space telescopes is immense as well."

"After the Swiss Alps, Ueli Steck shifted his focus to the Himalayas. He was searching for something more challenging, and the south face of Annapurna was perfect for his project since it was extremely dangerous. Even though the climb was severely demanding, Ueli was impossible to stop. Annapurna had a 1:3 death to Summit rate. The rockfalls and the avalanches on the mountain were constant and deadly.
It was assumed that Ueli would stop climbing after strong winds started to blow, creating avalanches all across the face, but the next morning, when his team saw Ueli return to the base, it became obvious to them that he did not stop and made it to the summit. Ueli's Annapurna climb became a point of debate since he did not have a single picture taken on the summit. People demanded proof, but there was none. Ueli admitted that he should have carried proof, but then again, several more important things were going through his mind, and safely making it back to the base was the dominating one. While many believe he indeed made it to the top, some argue that it might be untrue. People were left wondering if the media was responsible for pushing Ueli Steck to the point where he had to lie to prove himself."

"The film is told from three perspectives: interviews with the show's three lead writers: Jess Oppenheimer (who was also the show runner), Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll; flashbacks; and preparations for a live taping in 1953. In 1939, Ball, 28, is an actress contracted to RKO Pictures. She gets small parts in big studio productions, but featured mainly in low budget films which gives her the moniker ""Queen of the B-Movies."" She is cast in the comedy Too Many Girls, a film Pugh describes as a bad play made into an even worse movie. She meets one of the film's cast, charismatic 22-year-old Cuban singer Desi Arnaz and the two fall for each other instantaneously. Months after filming, they marry and buy a home in Hollywood. Desi has a successful stint fronting the Desi Arnaz Orchestra that tours around the country, while Lucy continues her film career with little success. After Desi serves in World War II, he resumes his success with his orchestra, with Lucy having to accompany him because of his cheating. Lucy finally gets a break when she is cast in 1942's The Big Street. The film is only a modest hit, but Ball's performance is praised. She meets with RKO President Charles Koerner confident she will get better scripts on par with established stars like Rita Hayworth and Bette Davis. But Koerner terminates her contract as several actresses RKO loaned to other studios will be returning and there will be nothing for her. He suggests she use her voice for radio, and with no substantial film roles coming, she does. In 1948, she is cast in the radio show My Favorite Husband, which becomes a success. The show draws interest from CBS and Philip Morris, but Ball only agrees if Desi plays her on screen husband. The executives refuse because Arnaz is Hispanic, but relent after Lucy refuses to give them the show. Ball also hopes that working with Desi will curb his cheating and save their marriage. By 1953, the show is renamed I Love Lucy and becomes a smash hit with nearly 60 million viewers each week. A three camera system, designed by Desi, allows viewers on the East Coast to see the show live and without static. Lucy deals with several issues on the show. Vivian Vance and William Frawley, who play the Ricardos' married neighbors the Mertzes, cannot get along, and Frawley's drunkeness on the set. Lucy also clashes with the directors and writers at the table reads, scene blockings and run throughs. Particularly a scene where Desi comes home and covers Lucy's eyes while she sets the table, and she names several different men before Desi reveals it's him. The writers and director find the scene controversial as it will imply adultery. The couple announce to CBS and Phillip Morris executives that Lucy is pregnant. They insist Lucy hide the pregnancy behind large objects, but the couple refuse and that the pregnancy will be shown (though they are never allowed to say the word on television). Lucy also deals with Desi being out late, and tales and a picture in the tabloids about him being with another woman. He tells her he plays cards on a boat with some other celebrities and sleeps there when he is too tired to come home, and the picture is 6 months old. She reluctantly believes him. Frawley has Lucy understand that Desi's adultery may stem from her making the business and creative decisions on the show which makes him feel emasculated, though she tells everyone he makes all the decisions. She asks Jess to give Arnaz a producer credit hoping it will stop Desi's cheating and save the marriage. Oppenheimer, instead tells Desi that has top billing being the ""I"" in I love Lucy to placate him. Lucy confronts him, and Oppenheimer relents. The night of the live filming, a newspaper article deems Lucy a Communist, though she was cleared during a HUAC hearing months earlier. Lucy admits she registered as a member of the Communist Party, but Desi insists she lie and say she accidentally marked the wrong box to which she refuses. Desi cancels his usual warm up to inform the audience of the accusations. He takes a live call with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who assures the crew and audience that Lucy has been cleared of all the charges. As the couple celebrates backstage, Lucy shows Desi a handkerchief with lipstick on it. Desi says it's hers, but Lucy shows him another one with her own lipstick on it, proving Desi's infidelity. When taping begins, Lucy momentarily loses her concentration. They start over, with Lucy focused. The film ends with a title card saying Ball filed for divorce after the taping of the last show in 1960."

(Jean-Claude Van Damme) (Alan Arkin). They examine the map, and upon doing so, they
discover that it details the location of an artifact known as the Zodiac Stone. Utilizing this artifact
during the Chinese New Year transforms its users into powerful animals.
The Vicious 6 traveled by plane to a remote island in search of the Stone. Wild Knuckles makes
his way inside the temple and discovers the Zodiac Stone, but as soon as he does so, he is
ambushed by a number of small metal guardians. He engages them in combat and then
escapes the temple, only to discover that additional temple guards are pursuing him. The
remaining five of the six pull Knuckles up, but then they steal the Stone from him and turn the
tables on him, telling him that he is too old to lead the team and that they need new blood to
take over instead. They cast Knuckles into the water and then take off into the sky.
Young Gru, played by Steve Carell, is 11 years old and has always had the ambition of
becoming a supervillain. As a result, the other children view him as a peculiar individual and
avoid his company. Kevin, Bob, and Stuart are the ones who come to get him (all Pierre Coffin,
along with the rest of the Minions). They make their way back to Gru's residence, where he
discovers something that was sent to him in the mail. It is a message from Belle Bottom, as Gru
had sent an application to join the Vicious 6 since he is their biggest fan, and Knuckles is his
favorite villain. The context of the message is that Knuckles is Gru's favorite villain (or, was). Gru
receives an invitation from Belle to attend an audition that will take place at the Criminal
Records shop. Gru is ecstatic and believes that his time to shine as a supervillain has finally
arrived. He is seen just living with his unsupportive mother Marlena, who is played by Julie
Andrews, as well as the rest of the Minions that he has employed as his henchmen. He is seen
just living with them. Gru relays the exciting news to the Minions, who enthusiastically rally
behind their ""mini boss"" despite Gru's displeasure with the moniker.
It has been discovered that Wild Knuckles is in fact still alive and is currently residing in his
mansion along with three of his own goons (John DiMaggio, Kevin Michael Richardson, and
Jimmy O. Yang). He hasn't gotten over the fact that the Vicious 6 kicked him off his own team,
and now he's heard that they're looking for a new member to join them. This has made him very
bitter.
The following day, Gru makes it to Criminal Records, where he is introduced to a younger
version of Dr. Nefario, played by Russell Brand and described as an ambitious mad scientist. He
demonstrates one of his most recent creations to Gru, which is a rifle that fires a sticky green
hand that can grab anything. Nefario hands it over to Gru and then walks him through the
hidden passageway that leads to the Vicious 6's lair. However, when he finally meets them, they
dismiss him for being a youngster because Jean-Clawed imagined that he was a tiny man when
they were reviewing his application. As they walk away, another candidate walks in and tries to
impress everyone with his pilot outfit, but his jetpack suddenly stops working, causing him to
soar erratically through the air. The Vicious 6 make an effort to stop him, which diverts their
attention just as Gru discovers the Zodiac Stone hiding behind them. He steals the Stone by
using the revolver that Nefario gave him, but the six of them find him and begin to pursue him.
Gru catches up with the other minions and hands the Stone over to one of them, named Otto.
Gru flees on his horse while the six warriors pursue him. He makes it so that Strong Hold and
Nun-Chuck are unable to defend themselves, and when Belle and Svengeance grab a hold of
Gru's bike, he uses the rocket to get them out from there as quickly as possible. Knuckles, who
was there the whole time, now follows Gru around in his vehicle after seeing all that happened.
Once Gru and the other Minions have returned to their home, they wait for Otto to return from
work. When he does, he gives Gru a rock that has googly eyes attached to it as a gift. Otto adds
that he ended up going through a series of unfortunate events until he found up at a birthday
party, at which point he traded the Stone for the pet rock that was being given away to the
birthday boy. Because of Otto's mistake, Gru is fuming with rage, and he immediately fires all of
the Minion workers. He sets off on his own to locate the Stone, but as he walks along the street,
the goons working for Knuckles capture him and put him into their van, as Kevin watches from
outside the window of the vehicle. He then proceeds to inform the other Minion workers that
their mini boss has been taken hostage.
Gru is taken to where Wild Knuckles has been hiding out. Knuckles is perturbed to discover that
Gru is not in possession of the Stone, which causes Gru to be overjoyed at the prospect of
meeting his hero. He calls Gru's house in an effort to coerce his mother into paying a ransom,
but Kevin answers the phone instead. Knuckles tells him to bring the Stone to San Francisco
within the next two days or they will kill Gru.
Otto, Kevin, and Stuart go to the kid's house that Otto gave the Stone to, and Bob joins them
there as well. The youngster explains that he handed it over to his uncle, who goes by the name
RZA and is already riding away on a motorcycle. Otto and the other three Minions chase after
him on a tricycle as they search for a bus for an advertisement to take them to San Francisco.
They go to the airport, where they put on disguises and pretend to be pilots and a flight
attendant in order to join the following flight. Kevin and Stuart make an attempt to fly, but they
wind up messing everything up by pressing all of the buttons and making a whole mess of
things before safely landing (sort of).
Knuckles torments Gru by placing him in a gadget resembling a record player, which brings him
closer and closer to saws that are rotating. He dispatches his underlings into the world, and
those underlings end up discovering the Minions. They attempt to seize them since they believe
the Stone is in their possession, and as a result, they find themselves in Chinatown, where an
acupuncturist named Master Chow (Michelle Yeoh) watches the goons beat on the Minions.
Chow, despite her age and the fact that she is a little old lady, demonstrates remarkable kung fu
skills and fights off the goons. Chow informs the Minions that she is no longer active in that line
of work when they beg her to teach them her abilities. Nevertheless, she gives in after the three
of them give her the puppy eye expression.
After the incident, the henchmen decided to give up on Knuckles. After rescuing Gru from the
trap, he puts Gru to work around the house. Knuckles drowns while he is in the process of
cleaning his crocodile-filled pool. Knuckles is grateful that Gru was able to rescue him and drag
him out of the pit in which he was trapped. He takes Gru along with him on the burglary. They
pretend to be a grandfather and grandson so that they can rob the Bank of Evil. Knuckles acts
as though he is having a heart attack so that Gru can steal the keys from Mr. Perkins' house
(Will Arnett). Gru is successful in his attempt to steal the Mona Lisa, much to Knuckles' delight.
Otto pursues the Biker on his tricycle through a number of states, but he is unable to keep up
with him and eventually loses sight of him. Otto is eventually found by the Biker, who then takes
him up, transports him to San Francisco on his motorcycle, and presents him with the Stone.
Chow teaches the Minion gang various forms of martial arts, but more often than not, the Minion
gang injures themselves rather than improving their skills. They are able to quickly improve their
talents, despite Chow's assertion that they have only passed the basic training. Unfortunately,
the Minions have already made their escape, and they are already traveling to help Gru.
The Vicious 6 locate Gru's house, rip off its roof, and then question Marlena and the other
Minions about the whereabouts of Gru. The fact that Gru was kidnapped by Knuckles is
revealed by one of the Minions. The group of six then travels to Knuckles' residence, where they
proceed to rip the roof off, search the property thoroughly, and come up empty-handed.
When Knuckles and Gru return, they find that Gru's home has been demolished. He is angry
because he is aware that the 6 were the ones who did this, and he is frustrated that they would
still try to injure him after all of this time has passed. In spite of Gru's protests, he breaks the
news to him that he is given up and just instructs him to go back home.
A parade celebrating the Chinese New Year is currently taking place downtown. Otto ultimately
causes a commotion by dashing into the crowd. Gru spies him as he is on the trolley and
immediately starts chasing after him. Otto reveals the Stone to Gru, who then professes his
admiration for Otto. Regrettably, the Vicious 6 have managed to catch up to them, and now
have Gru in their custody. In the nick of time, just as they are about to be surrounded by the
Anti-Villain League, Belle seizes the Stone and uses its abilities to transform both her and the
crew into enormous animal monsters. Strong Hold transforms into a bull, Nun-Chuck into a
snake, Svengeance into a tiger, and Jean-Clawed into a monstrous monkey. Belle transforms
into a dragon that breathes fire (with his lobster claw arm). They seize Gru and bind him to the
hands of a clock tower, which will gradually rip him to pieces over time.
Knuckles, Kevin, Stuart, and Bob all appear to come to Gru's rescue at the same time. The
three are reincarnated as a rabbit, a chicken, and a ram after being transformed by Belle.
Despite the fact that Knuckles puts up a valiant effort, Belle is able to defeat him with her fire
breath. The three individuals recall what Chow had said and let loose their inner animals; they
then proceed to defeat the mutated version of Vicious 6. Gru is set free by Otto, and he
immediately heads off to assist his buddies. The three Minions easily dispatch the six, and Gru
seizes the Stone, which he then employs to transform his opponents into rats. They were taken
into arrest by the AVL when they arrived. Knuckles suffers an injury and is subsequently
detained; nonetheless, he assures Gru that they will meet again in the near future.
The scene then cuts to a funeral, where it would appear that Knuckles has passed away. Gru
delivers a heartfelt eulogy for him, only to later discover that Knuckles staged his own death and
is in hiding. Following the performance of the Minion version of ""You Can't Always Get What You
Want,"" Gru is reunited with his idol, and the two of them continue their journey into the sunset
with the remaining Minions.
During the roll of credits, Gru leads the rehired Minions to the Criminal Records business, which
has the appearance of being closed. Gru asks Dr. Nefario whether he would be interested in
officially working for him and building gadgets, but Nefario responds by saying that he is retiring
from the criminal underworld. After Gru and the Minions have successfully persuaded him with
their puppy eyes, he reveals a surprise to Gru, which is the rocket car that Gru is seen driving as
an adult. The newly formed evil crew immediately sets its sights on committing even more
heinous acts"

"Meera and Henry are a married couple living in an isolated, ultra-modern house in Corrales, New Mexico, which Henry designed and built. Meera is a cancer survivor, and worries that the disease may return, but Henry is very understanding and supportive.
One evening, after returning home from a date night, the couple find that their house has been broken into and the living room trashed. The only things stolen are a laptop and their cell phones (which they left behind so as not to be a distraction during their date). After a visit from a detective (who, hearing pipes rattling, suggests they need a plumber), Henry installs a security system at the house.
A few days later, Meera is woken in the night by strange noises in the house, like rattling pipes. When she tries the lights, they do not work. Henry goes outside to check the generator and finds it has been smashed. He sees flashlight beams in the windows of the house and realizes the intruders have returned. Dashing back inside, he finds Meera bound and gagged in the bedroom. He releases her and they try to escape, but are pursued by masked men. Meera manages to get to the couple's car, but then hears gunshots from inside the house. A wounded man staggers outside, followed by Henry, who shoots and kills him.
The next day, at the police station, Meera and Henry are shown mugshots of the three intruders, one of whom is still alive and in ICU at the local hospital. They were all from the Cobb family, living in a rundown trailer park on the outskirts of town. They also learn that a young woman from the same family has recently gone missing.
Meera is left extremely traumatized by these events, and also by the discovery that Henry kept a hidden gun. Henry assures her he has got rid of it, and suggests that despite what has happened, they should go ahead with the housewarming party they had intended to give. With this in mind, he drives off to buy supplies for the party. Meera notices he has left his wallet, and when she cannot reach him by phone, she decides to follow him to the store. She soon catches up with his car, but to her surprise he turns off at the hospital. Distracted by this, she collides with another vehicle.
Meera's car is taken to the body shop and she takes an Uber home. She tells Henry what happened and asks why he went to the hospital. He tells her he just took a wrong turn.
With her own car out of action, Meera borrows Henry's car to get to work. In the car park, she meets the detective in charge of the case. He tells her the surviving intruder has died, so the case is now closed. Meera also learns that the man died on the night she followed Henry to the hospital.
Now deeply suspicious, Meera looks through the GPS record on Henry's vehicle and sees the Cobb home address. She goes there and manages to enter their trailer. Inside, she finds an envelope bearing the logo of Henry's construction company, with the address written in his handwriting. Meera opens the family's mailbox and finds a package containing a video camera. A neighbor appears and confronts her, saying he saw her car there a few days before and accusing her of ""snooping"". He seizes the package and bangs it against a wall. Meera grabs the package and leaves.
Back home, she tries to play the video, but it will not work properly; she sees only the image of Dylan Cobb. She orders another camera online, arranging to have it delivered to her work address. She decides to search Henry's office and finds a USB chip with photos of the construction of their house. Dylan appears in the photos as one of the construction team. Henry arrives home and so she has to cut short her search, but later that night she studies the photos again and this time sees images of Christine, the missing girl. The next day, Meera confronts Henry; she wants to know why an envelope with his handwriting was at the Cobb trailer, why he himself had visited the trailer, why he started keeping a gun, and how come he has pictures of the missing girl on his computer. Henry explains he was short of cash to complete building the house, and he committed fraud in order to get extra cash, but intended to repay the money. Dylan Cobb had worked for him, but Henry fired him after he saw Dylan ill-treating his daughter; Dylan was enraged and swore revenge, and also threatened to expose Henry's dodgy financial dealings. Henry had been paying Dylan to keep quiet, but after he stopped paying, Dylan and the other Cobb men broke into the house.
Meera is reassured by Henry's explanation, and happiness is restored. When the new video camera arrives, she is no longer interested in looking at the film she found at the Cobb home. Finally it is the night of the housewarming party, and with the house full of guests the party is in full swing. When Meera happens to see a TV news item about the still-missing Christine Cobb, her suspicions are reawakened. She gets the new video camera and plays the tape. On it, Dylan Cobb talks about how he did not like the way Henry looked at his daughter, and that after Christine went missing, Dylan went to Henry's house with his dog, which started barking furiously in the vicinity of the office.
Meera goes to Henry's office and finds a hidden switch, which opens a secret door to a basement. Down in the basement, Christine is discovered bound to a chair, attached to pipes by chains; this is the cause of the mysterious banging noises which have occasionally been heard in the house. Meera tries to free the girl, but Henry arrives in the basement before she succeeds. He tells Meera that he has always had perverted urges, but that he did not choose to be this way. Meera finally realizes that the reason Henry built their isolated home was so he could have a secret place to keep his victims. She attempts to call 911, but Henry overpowers her and ties her up. Back upstairs, he tells their guests that Meera has had too much to drink and has gone to bed, and he sends the guests home. Meera manages to get free of her bonds and she also frees Christine. Henry comes back down to the basement while they are trying to escape, and a chase ensues. Henry knocks out Meera and drags Christine back down to the basement. There, he ties her up again and is about to kill her with a baseball bat, but instead he is fatally wounded when a revived Meera appears and smashes him in the head with a clock. Ironically it is a clock he had given her as a special present on their first date. A dying Henry asks Meera what she will do when she no longer has him to take care of her; she replies that she will take care of herself. A final scene shows a sunny day and Meera moving out of the now empty house, and driving away."

"The next morning, Efron tries to kill a snake for food but fails to match up with its slithery movements and continues on with a hungry body. In the afternoon, he goes over to the plane crash site again and, this time, spots a human figure coming toward him. He attempts to hide in the plane unsuccessfully and ultimately has to come out to face the stranger. This person, a woman dressed and armed appropriately for the desert, is a scavenger who goes around looting whatever and whoever she can and survives with it. She pesters Efron for a long time, trying to find out who he is and what he is doing alone in the middle of nowhere. When the man does not give any certain replies and just tries to avoid the conversation, the woman follows him back to his camp and tries to destroy his hut. When stopped, she tries to establish Efron as an outsider who is unfairly trying to take away resources from natives of the place like her, and then grows aggressive. Possibly in an attempt to protect himself, Efron strikes the woman with a shovel and, perhaps unwillingly, kills her. Taking away whatever he could find on her, he digs up a hole and buries her body in it, but soon sees the hungry wild dogs dig it up and try to eat it. He quickly gathers some more wood and burns up the body, for he does not want to disrespect her by feeding her remains to the dogs. The next day, he receives a call on the satellite phone from Hayes, who says that he is now bringing the excavator back to the place and promises to reach it within two or three days. Efron notices a local vehicle passing by and once thinks of asking for help and running away from his situation, but his greed, and also perhaps a sense that ""the situation is equally bad everywhere else,"" holds him back. Soon, a major sandstorm hits the place, and the man gets terribly injured when a flying tree branch impales his belly. After the storm has completely changed the look of the sandy desert, Efron crawls around with great pain and manages to find the gold nugget after a lot of effort. He also struggles to treat his wound and then falls into a hallucinatory trance and thinks that he imagines the woman he had earlier killed is now alive again. However, soon it is revealed that there is actually a second woman who looks exactly like the first, and she asks Efron if he has seen her sister, suggesting that they were twins. When the man denies seeing anyone, the woman offers to help him walk him to the nearest water source and settlement, but Efron insists on being left alone. As he seems to pass out and wake up again, he sees himself amidst a circle of small fires, definitely lit by the woman, as a group of dogs already move towards him, realizing that the man is about to die soon. As the fires grow weaker and the dogs' collective will and courage stronger, they start to attack Efron one by one, tearing into his flesh and finally dragging him away and biting him to death."

"This is a true story of how one man's protest helped change society. Born into a violent, poverty-stricken, God-fearing family in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, Peter Tatchell moved to London as a young man and channeled many of his adverse childhood experiences into a lifelong fight against tyranny, inequality, and injustice. Vilified by the British press and regularly bashed for his endeavours, Hating Peter Tatchell explores what has driven the controversial human rights campaigner to risk his life again and again by staging more than three thousand provocative acts of civil disobedience.
In an intimate interview with Peter, celebrated film actor and fellow gay rights activist, Ian McKellen, probes what has inspired, motivated, and fuelled Peter Tatchell's six-decade assault on the prejudices of the British establishment and his long career fighting injustices across the globe.
Peter's journey begins in the anti-Vietnam War movement when he is just a teenager. To avoid compulsory conscription in what he believes is an unjust war, he sails from Australia to London and falls in with the Gay Liberation Front, helping to organise the UK's first gay pride parade.
Looking to shake up the establishment, in the early 1980s, Peter makes a move into the political mainstream by standing as a Labour candidate in the Bermondsey by-election. He finds himself embroiled in one of the most vicious and notoriously homophobic smear campaigns in British electoral history. When he loses the election, Peter vows to never play by the rules again. He's tried playing by the rules. Now he's going to break them.
Abandoning traditional politics, Peter diverts his energies into the radical non-violent gay rights direct action group OutRage! and takes the fight for equality to the very pillars of the British establishment. Using provocative stunts, wicked humour and theatrical forms of protest, OutRage! lives up to its name by confronting everyone from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Experiencing the full wrath of the church, state, and media, Peter is dubbed 'the most hated man in Britain'. Unbowed and defiant, he ups the ante by attempting a citizen's arrest on Zimbabwean tyrant Robert Mugabe and by shirtfronting homophobic trash-talking heavyweight boxing champion of the world Mike Tyson.
As social attitudes change and history vindicates Peter's stance on gay rights, his David versus Goliath battles gradually win him first grudging approval and then status as a national treasure. Now Peter is embarking on his riskiest crusade yet as he seeks to stage a protest at the FIFA World Cup in Moscow to draw attention to the persecution of LGBT+ people in Russia and Chechnya. All he has to do is not get killed, bashed, imprisoned, or 'disappeared' by Putin's goons, the might of the Russian security state, and roving gangs of Neo-Nazis.
What could possibly go wrong?

He says that society is set up in a way that the poor and the uneducated pay the highest price for man-made disasters. He reckons he and his family are not ""exposed"". This ""Airborne Toxic Event"" (the event was upgraded from ""feathery plume"" to ""Dark billowing Cloud"" to ""Airborne toxic event"" on the radio in short duration) forces a massive evacuation as a cloud of deadly chemicals (Nyodene D) moves towards the town, which leads to a major traffic jam on the highway. As they are on the highway, there are recommendations on the radio that people should remain indoors, and if have already evacuated, they should find shelter quickly. The progress on the highway is slow due to multiple accidents along the way. The car is soon running out of gas.
Jack drives to a gas station to refill his car, where he is inadvertently exposed to the cloud. soon, the airborne toxic event, becomes a huge cloud of smoke, that brings its own weather and thunder and covers the entire town and surrounding highways.
The family and numerous others are forced into quarantine at a summer camp. Jack's daughter Denise tells him that he got exposed to the cloud at the gas station for 2.5 mins. He goes to report himself to the medical desk, where he is told to continue his life. The exposure is real, but the side effects of the exposure will only be known in the next 15 yrs, as the chemical has a life of 30 yrs.

They later arrive in Iron City, where they encounter a man who rants about the lack of media attention on the evacuees and spots Jack, claiming he had seen him before looking at him. After nine days, the family manages to return home. However, since Jack was briefly exposed to the chemical waste, his fear of death becomes exacerbated."

On top of everything as they prepare a Chinese New Year's Eve party under the pressure of trying to meet the exacting standards of her father, she and Waymond are in the middle of an IRS audit, their auditor hard-nosed Deirdre Beaubeirdre. As Evelyn and Waymond enter into what is supposed to be their final ""show me the proper paperwork or else"" meeting with Deirdre, Evelyn will physically and metaphysically enter into alternate universes, where she not only has to make the right choices to save the collective universe, but arguably more importantly come to a true understanding of herself."
"In 1994, a man named Lynn Loud meets a crossing guard named Rita while walking down the street. They experience love at first sight, and Rita invites him out on a date. After many dates, the two of them get married, then buy a suburban house for them to live in. During their first year in the house, they give birth to their first child, a daughter named Lori, followed by four more daughters named Leni, Luna, Luan, and Lynn Jr. After they have five daughters, they give birth to their first son, an albino boy named Lincoln. After Lincoln, the two of them go on to have five more daughters named Lucy, Lana, Lola, Lisa, and Lily. In the present day (2017), Lincoln, who has become the family's ""man with the plan"" as he likes to call himself, teaches Lily how to create and execute a plan as they decide to be the first ones to eat their father's breakfast burritos. While their sisters end up getting ready before them, Lincoln is able to prevent them from further intervening in their plan by sending them out of the house against their will, noting how the key to having a plan is to always have a backup plan. After they begin eating their burritos, they soon learn that all of the girls have activities that day. Lincoln helps out his sisters, and they take home several awards after they finish their activities. That night, when the family goes out to eat, the girls pose for a group photo where they show off their awards. Lincoln attempts to join them in the photo because he is also part of the family and did plenty of work to help them, but he gets abusively shoved out of the frame and locked outside, and the public completely ignores him in favor of his sisters. This causes Lincoln to wish that he was special, and he decides to visit his best friend, Clyde. During the visit, Clyde talks about how he had recently taken a vacation to France, where he learned that he was descended from a long line of bakers and found out that he was just as skilled as his ancestors were. This inspires Lincoln to ask his family to take a vacation to their place of origin. After collecting a DNA sample from Lynn Sr., Lisa concludes that their family originated from Scotland, so the family takes a vacation there. Upon arriving in Scotland, they find themselves in a small town called Loch Loud, which, while still decently inhabited, is relatively dysfunctional and noticeably requires improvement. The Loud family soon learns that they are descended from royalty from a man named Angus, who works as the groundskeeper for their ancestral castle. After taking them to the castle, he introduces them to the castle's caretaker, Morag, who noticeably enjoys being in a peaceful and quiet setting more than anything. He then invites them to stay in the castle while on vacation, given that their ancestors lived in it. They accept the offer, and once they begin exploring the castle, Angus decides to talk to Lincoln after noticing his fascination with fame and recognition. He explains that the royal family was very special and well-known among the townspeople, but the most special of all of the Loud family's ancestors was Lincoln's double, who was the duke of the town. After being taken to the duke's room, Lincoln decides that he wants to be just like his ancestor. Suddenly, Lynn and Lana arrive in the duke's room, having noticed the cave near the castle with a prominent dragon motif, and ask Angus to explain why it exists. While Angus takes the two girls to the cave, he explains that dragons are an important part of the town's history, and the royal family owned a real dragon back in their time. Soon, he discovers that the only dragon egg left in the cave has hatched, meaning that a dragon is on the loose. After they catch up with the dragon, they bring it to the castle, where Lily names it Lela. Suddenly, Lincoln emerges from the duke's room, wearing the duke's clothes and having decided that he wants to become the duke. At dinner that night, Angus explains that the only way Lincoln can become the duke is by making an effort to help out the townspeople. The next day, Lincoln helps out the townspeople (with help from Angus, as he needed to learn along the way that being the duke is about more than being popular and self-entitled), which manages to convince them that he would make the perfect duke. However, Morag, who wants to regain her peace and quiet after the Loud family leaves, blurts out that Lincoln is a tourist, which causes the town's citizens to abandon him. Lincoln then convinces his family to move into the town, which they agree to after being manipulated by him, and he is later crowned as the duke. Soon, as Lincoln is enjoying himself, living as his ancestor did four hundred years before him, Morag sneaks away from the castle to the highlands, where she completely snaps and openly expresses her hatred for the Loud family. She then digs up her distant ancestor, Aggie's, journal, where she uncovers a dragon-controlling gem. She plots to use it to exile Lincoln from Scotland, just as her ancestor did to her duke. That night, Lucy summons the ghost of her distant ancestral double, Lucille, who explains the true story of the royal family's departure from Loch Loud: They left for a temporary amount of time, but upon returning, the duke's dragon friend, Lolo, attacked their ship. Lucille had assumed that Lolo had deemed her brother, the duke, to be worthy no more, and he thus handed over his crown before sending them all away to a new land. What none of them knew was that Aggie, the castle's historical caretaker, was controlling the dragon with a gem, and she had plotted to exile the duke from Scotland out of frustration for never getting a moment of peace and quiet as a result of the large royal family's presence. After Lucille finishes explaining the story of the royal family's departure, Morag arrives back at the castle, then eavesdrops on Lincoln, where she learns that his greatest weakness is being stuck in his sisters' shadows. She then decides to motivate him to abdicate the throne, then usurp the throne and become the duchess. The next day, she invites Lincoln's sisters to perform in front of the town, since their ancestors were widely known for their many areas of expertise. While Lincoln is cleaning out chimneys throughout the town later that day, he notices a flyer promoting his sisters performing in the town, which causes him to lose his confidence about being special and popular due to his royal status. Morag then convinces him to ride the dragon like his ancestor once did, and Lincoln agrees to the offer. Sure enough, the townspeople admire Lincoln as he rides the dragon, but during his dragon ride, Morag takes control of the dragon using the gem she found in Aggie's journal. With Morag now in control of the dragon, property destruction ensues throughout the town, and the townspeople blame Lincoln for it. They later form a mob against him, which motivates him to abdicate the throne and leave Scotland. After the Loud family leaves Scotland, Morag usurps the throne and becomes the duchess. Angus and the townspeople begin opposing her because this action is unlawful (as the Loud family did not give her consent to become the duchess after they left, as she claimed soon before her coronation), and not wanting to be opposed, Morag attacks the town using the dragon. Meanwhile, Lucille learns from Aggie's journal that Aggie betrayed the royal family back in their time and was responsible for the original duke abdicating the throne, and she soon reveals the truth to the current Loud family. After telling them that Morag is attacking the town and sending all of its residents into exile, they return to the town and battle against her. Lincoln soon confronts Morag face-to-face and begins to battle for the crown. However, they lose focus of where the dragon (which they are standing on) is going, and they crash through the castle walls. Morag prepares to kill the entire Loud family and Angus, but Lincoln is able to prevent this by attracting Morag away from them by taking the crown with him. During Morag's last-ditch effort to murder Lincoln, Lincoln uses a magic trick to replace the dragon-controlling gem with a burrito, then destroys the gem so Morag cannot control the dragon anymore. After another fight over the crown, they fall off a cliff, but the dragon manages to prevent them from dying. The dragon takes Lincoln back to the castle, but leaves Morag stranded on an island populated by noisy seals. After Lincoln arrives back at the castle, he decides that he does not deserve to be the duke and instead decides to crown Angus as the duke, since he knows the town better than anybody else. After doing so, the Loud family helps to rebuild the town together with Angus and the ghosts of their ancestors, then they leave Scotland to return back home, satisfied with how they have helped the town."

"The story begins in 1979. Beth is with her boyfriend Charles in her room. Her little sister is wandering the house but Beth is hardly bothered since she's busy with her boyfriend.
The next instant, the sister screams and Beth has to take Charles and look for her sister. They find her in a room, staring at the mirror and pointing.
As soon as they approach her, a pair of hands grab the sister from behind.
Forty years later, two girls are taken to live with their Aunt Beth after their mother has passed away and their father is taking forever to come get them.
The eldest is Olivia and the youngest Claire, who also has a stuffed toy bunny, through which she does her talking because she's traumatized by her mother's death.
Aunt Beth clearly doesn't want the girls at the house and tells them not to go into her study or the basement.
Claire's bunny agrees to follow the rules.
Charles has prepared dinner for the girls and is a much better companion than Aunt Beth who is still frowning at the girls. He's made some weird stew that Olivia eats but Claire doesn't. When she's prodded to eat, she chokes on it because Charles has put peanut butter in the stew.
Olivia stabs her sister's thigh with an EpiPen and saves her life.
That night, Claire is beckoned by voices in the dark and told to do exactly what Aunt Beth forbid her to do. Claire enters the study and finds Aunt Beth Adler after drinking wine. She finds a box in the drawer, retrieves a key and heads to the basement.
Olivia is sleeping peacefully through all this considering a few moments ago she had spotted something weird in the reflection of a mirror covered with paper in the bathroom.
Claire finds the mirrors in the basement and someone begins writing in the dusty mirrors. Claire thinks it's her mother who wants to come back into the living world.
She's told to repeat the words that will open the mirrors and help the spirits come inside. Claire says the rhyme thrice and sees something in the reflection.
The next morning, Claire takes Olivia to the study and shows her a newspaper clipping that Aunt Beth has saved all these years because it is about her being convicted for killing her parents and sister.
Olivia realizes they are in trouble and calls the woman, Camilla, who has taken charge of them. She agrees to come immediately.
Olivia and Claire prepare to run away but the younger girl begins to act weird. Over dinner, she claims she wants to stay in the house and not go with her father. She's also feasting on dinner as if she's never eaten before.
With Beth and Charles exchange uneasy looks. Beth already knows someone has been in her study because the box has been moved.
The two quickly subdue the girls and separate them. Olivia awakens a little later and finds herself locked in a room. She looks out to see that the Camilla has arrived but is being sent away by Charles. Olivia bangs on the window but no one looks up.
Later, Camilla returns and promises to help her out. Olivia confronts Beth and Charles, and Camilla enters with a gun that was in Charles' car. They get Claire even though Beth warns that ""it"" will not want to leave the house.
In the car, Claire cries about leaving her bunny behind. Now that Beth and Charles are locked in a room, Camilla tells Olivia to get the bunny.
Olivia doesn't find the bunny anywhere but comes downstairs to see it by the door.
Olivia goes out and sees bloodstains on the car windows. Camilla has been killed and Claire is nowhere to be found.
Olivia lets out Beth and Charles who reveal that the house is inhabited by an entity that wants to come into the living world. According to Beth, her sister killed her parents so she had to kill her in order to stop the entity from coming out. She says she happily took the blame for the murders but came back to stop the entity once and for all.
Charles is still with her because Beth doesn't take his name during the investigation and he was allowed to live a normal life.
Beth hopes there is another way to stop the entity rather than kill the body it wants to possess.
They try breaking mirrors and use reflections to see the entity once they find out it can be hurt.
That plan goes horribly wrong. Olivia finds Claire laying on a plastic sheet as Beth and Charles are getting ready to murder her.
Olivia argues that Beth never really tries another way to defeat the entity and just likes to murder people. Charles is easily swayed by this speech and decides to help Olivia.
Their plan is to feed Claire peanut butter so that she chokes. Then when the spirit leaves her, they will revive her with an EpiPen. It takes them around three EpiPens before Claire is revived.
Olivia and Claire are getting ready to leave the next day. Charles is glib when he tells them Beth is in a sour mood because she was sure stabbing someone was the only way to defeat the evil.
The girls are about to leave when they find the doors locked. Beth rushes to them and she claims that the entity is now caught between both worlds and can hurt them, which the entity does immediately by stabbing a piece of glass into Charles' throat.
Claire thinks this is her fault and uses the words to get the evil inside her. Beth tells Olivia to stop her sister from doing so.
Beth decides to be a martyr and says the word herself while handing Olivia a shard of the mirror. The entity enters like black smoke and possesses Beth. Olivia stabs her immediately.
The police and ambulance arrive. Olivia is happy to be reunited with her sister. A police officer informs them that this incident would be treated as a murder-suicide. A candle burning inside the now isolated house suddenly blows itself off."

"Sherlock follows clues from Ferndell to Edith's tea shop, and asks to speak with her, bargaining for her time with the leverage of her banned books she lets her customers read. He inquires as to Eudoria's whereabouts, saying she needs to return to take care of Enola. Edith tells him Eudoria is doing good work to change the world, and Enola seems to be taking care of herself. Edith also tells him of the ""useless boy"" Enola ran into, and that she is also looking for Eudoria. She admits she is pleased that Sherlock is at least taking an interest, as Eudoria figured he would always ignore his younger sister. She says that Enola needs Sherlock, and advises him to find and help her.
Later, Enola arrives at Covent Garden Market, where she tracks down Tewkesbury selling flowers among the crowded stalls. He is pleased, if surprised, to see her again, and asks why she went through the trouble of finding him, thinking she might turn him in for the reward money being offered. She tells him that she is actually there because his life is still in danger, and they both confess to having missed each other since their departure. Enola takes him back to her lodgings house, where Tewkesbury finds a pile of newspapers. Enola explains how her mother left her, and she is waiting for a response to the message she sent her. They bond over both having lost their fathers, and how the rest of the people in their lives don't seem to want them. Enola tells Tewkesbury that despite his family being wealthy enough to send a detective to find him, someone in his family sent a murderer instead. Enola says that she is sure his father was actually murdered, and that whoever did it must want him dead for the same reason. She also informs him of her findings at Basilweather, and that the branch that nearly killed him had been intentionally cut. Lestrade ambushes them, but Enola notices him and counters. They manage to make it to Enola's room, but struggle to keep the door closed. Enola tells Tewkesbury to go out the window and disappear, as his life will be in jeopardy if he is caught, and there is not enough time for them both to escape. Tewkesbury argues, but Enola orders him to go, holding the door just long enough for him to get away, and is caught by Lestrade . She is turned over to Mycroft, who confiscates the money her mother gave her, and takes her to Miss Harrison's Finishing School for Young Ladies. She is kept locked in her room in between lessons, and tries to remain defiant of the headmistress, though her spirits begin to dwindle.
Later, Enola is told that her brother has come to visit her, and she is relieved to see that it is Sherlock. She checks his newspaper for a possible message, and is angry about her situation. Sherlock encourages her to take the lessons to heart, as they may come in handy in future cases. She asks him about Eudoria, and he says he has tracked her trail (albeit by following separate clues) and found the docks one step behind Enola's confrontation with Linthorn, and they discuss the bombs found there. She accuses him of helping Mycroft catch her, and seeing her only as a case, which he denies, and admits that he came because he cares about her. He asks her about the Tewkesbury case, having deduced that she was with the boy on the train. He is impressed with her detective work, he asks if she has solved the mystery yet. He gives her some advice, detective to detective, and also gives her Dash, the pine cone dog, having found it among Eudoria's things, telling Enola that he and Eudoria both find her extraordinary.
After Sherlock leaves, Enola looks through the paper, and finds that the Reform Bill is still tied in the House of Lords, and another article about the still missing marquis. Just then a large basket is delivered to Enola, supposedly from Mycroft, but is revealed to be Tewkesbury, having smuggled himself in. Enola is overjoyed to see him, and is relieved that he is alright. He intends to get her out the same way he came in, but Enola alters the plan to get around Miss Harrison's watchful eye. Tewkesbury delivers the basket with Enola inside to Miss Harrison, telling her it's from Mycroft (who she is sweet on), and Enola escapes while Miss Harrison sends the lad away. They steal her motorcar, and Enola tells Tewkesbury that he is being targeted to prevent him from taking his seat in the House of Lords and voting yes on the Reform Bill, and that his uncle (who would inherit the seat and vote no) has the most to gain by killing both his father and him.
Inspired by Sherlock's advice, Enola decides to go to Basilweather and confront Sir Whimbrel. They enter, but find the house dark and deserted, and are trapped inside by Linthorn, who was waiting for them and is wielding a shotgun. Enola and the marquis hide in the shadows, and narrowly avoid being shot. Enola jumps the gunman, but is rendered unconscious. Before Linthorn can kill her, Tewkesbury attacks him, knocking his gun away, but is also subdued. Linthorn begins to strangle Tewkesbury as Enola struggles to regain consciousness. She manages to grapple Linthorn, knocking him headfirst into a sharp fixture, killing him. The Dowager enters, and Tewkesbury is heartbroken to discover that it was she who hired Linthorn to kill him and his father. She picks up the shotgun, telling her grandson that she had to prevent him from voting on the Reform Bill. She tells him that she sent his mother and uncle back to London to look for him, and explains that the future of the country depends on his death. She shoots Tewkesbury in the chest in cold blood, seemingly killing him. Enola disarms the Dowager, and mourns over Tewkesbury. However, Tewkesbury wakes up, having only been knocked out from the impact, and reveals that he hid a steel chest plate from one of the suits of armor under his jacket, protecting him from the shot. He rises and tells the Dowager her time is over."

Afterwards, he is picked up by his partner, Nicks, who informs him they have received an anonymous tip-off call that a safe deposit box at a bank will be robbed. At the stakeout, they witness a mysterious man give unheard instructions to civilians, bank employees, and fellow policemen, who seemingly follow his commands as he enters the bank. Rourke races to the targeted safe deposit box, finding inside it a picture of Minnie with the message ""Find Lev Dellrayne"" written on it. Rourke pursues the man to a rooftop, where he witnesses him command two police officers to shoot each other as he escapes. Convinced the heist has something to do with the disappearance of his daughter, Rourke investigates. Trace run by Nicks on the tip-off call leads Rourke to the address of fortune-teller Diana Cruz. After he describes to her the man from the bank heist, a client of Cruz's, under the control of that man, drives a motorcycle through Cruz's window before killing himself. Rourke takes Cruz into protective custody. She explains that the mysterious man from the bank is named ""Lev Dellrayne"" and that he and Cruz are both the escaped ""Hypnotics"": powerful hypnotists trained by a secretive government ""Division"" to control people's minds. Rourke is mysteriously immune to such mind control when Cruz tries to exercise it on him. Meanwhile, Dellrayne outside the police station commands Nicks to attack Rourke and Cruz, and Cruz then shoots him dead in self-defense. Rourke and Cruz flee to Mexico. There, they learn from a former Division contact Jeremiah that Dellrayne is seeking ""Domino"", a powerful weapon developed by the Division, stolen, and hidden by Dellrayne when he escaped. Dellrayne then wiped his own memory and left behind ""triggers"" prompting him to gradually recall Domino's location and regain his own hypnotic power. Dellrayne eventually reveals himself to be Jeremiah in disguise and pursues Rourke and Cruz through a hypnotically constructed environment before Rourke taps into his own previously unknown hypnotic power, allowing them to escape. Rourke and Cruz seek out River, a reclusive Division hacker, who discovers Rourke's wife, Vivian, in Division's database. Later, Rourke investigates River's database himself, and discovers that Minnie is Domino, the daughter of two powerful hypnotics: Rourke and Cruz (who is revealed to be Vivian). As ""Cruz"" interrupts him, Rourke realizes that the room and all of the events up to this point have been hypnotic constructs. He wakes up in a large room populated by Division agents, all of whom he has seen throughout the constructed story, including Nicks and ""Dellrayne."" Vivian and ""Dellrayne"" explain that Rourke and Vivian are both hypnotics, and their daughter Minnie was born and raised within the Division, but that he escaped with her to stop her from becoming their weapon. Hiding her and then wiping his memory, Rourke no longer remembers where she is, and the Division has been putting him through constructs of the search for her to make him remember. Rourke is plugged back into the construct, where he repeats the session with his therapist and the stakeout at the bank heist. However, Rourke soon escapes using his own powers and flees as the Division realizes that ""Find Lev Dellrayne"" refers not to a person but ""Deer Valley Lane"": the location of a ranch where Rourke's foster parents have been hiding Minnie. Rourke arrives at the ranch and is reunited with Minnie, who is now aged three years and is in full control of her hypnotic powers. The Division surrounds the ranch, but it is all revealed to be another construct of Minnie's creation. Minnie restores Vivian's memories that she was involved in Rourke and Minnie's escape and that her memory was subsequently wiped so that when Minnie would be powerful enough to defeat the entire Division at once, Vivian could unwittingly lead them to her. Minnie forces the Division agents to kill each other, and she, her parents, and Rourke's foster parents celebrate their new-found freedom. In a mid-credits' scene, ""Dellrayne"" is revealed to have survived the shoot-out, having constructed Rourke's foster-father to look like him during the fight with Minnie."

Unfortunately, the Reagan administration begins to severely affect low level paying jobs and Frito-Lay's stocks begin to go down. This eventually results in some of the workers getting laid off.

Like the entries in the diary, the movie builds momentum in a series of two minute clip-bites which is difficult to synpo ....

"""Some things are beyond repair."" The In Between (2022) by writer, Marc Klein, is a supernatural Love Story about an aspiring photographer, ""Tessa"" (Joey King) desperately trying to make contact with ""Skylar"" (Kyle Allen), the boyfriend who died in a car accident (and seems to be trying to get her attention). Via poignant time-line clips, the story follows the grief-stricken Tessa on a backwards journey of reflection from waking up in the hospital (after the accident) to replaying memories of their sweet summer romance. Throughout all this, Skylar's persistent and obvious attempts to let Tessa know he's near, gradually succeed in crossing the line between heaven and earth and into a desperate embrace with the woman he loves and misses. It's a little scary and intense, but this is the moment Tessa has been hoping for. She and Skylar are once again together-Tessa being in a coma--and she must now choose between life on earth and spending eternity with Skylar. What we also see in this heartfelt and suspenseful romance is a masterful execution of romance-film conventions that pull us into the intimate bonding stages of this believable and budding relationship, while subtly tugging at our own emotions and beliefs of the afterlife. It's clever how Tessa's photography-which she never thinks is good enough for others to see--is cleverly woven as both the film's romantic motif as well as Tessa's other passion for living. And though the ending may seem predictable, the narrative has enough emotional twists and turns to make you guess otherwise."

"Present day Mira wakes injured and heavily intoxicated at her home. She tries to recall but to no avail. She finds a message on her phone with unknown number saying that she was in the forest and Nusrat is dead. She then finds a video of her that she accidentally recorded explaining how she wants to kill Nusrat. Scared she attends her support group/class where she explains on how after miscarriage she started using alcohol to heal herself, and how she became so dependent on it that she often became violent and forgot about it. She mentions on how celebrating Shekhar's promotion at home she has a drink too many and wakes in the morning only to Shekhar tell her how she hurled him with a corkscrew when he asked to stop drinking. Over multiple such stories she mentions how she got drunk at Shekhar's colleagues party and abused the host that caused Shekhar to get fired, and how on being asked to sign divorce papers she becomes enraged and breaks the mirror to no recollection. She is scared something similar had happened that day with Nusrat and she might have hurt her in her drunken state. She concludes that she has to remember that one night as that could be the only way out.
Post her session she meets Priya and before she can tell Priya anything, Kaur and Kunal show up asking her questions about that night. She lies that she doesn't recognize Nusrat, lies about her citizen card being stolen and lies about remembering anything about the night. This makes Kaur call her compulsive liar.
Since they don't have evidence they can't arrest her, they leave Mira who rushes to her doctor only to profess that she might have murdered Nusrat in drunken rage. Mira also contacts Anand, only to know the guy she saw Nusrat with was her psychiatrist, to this Anand admits that he wanted to Mira because he had hired a PI to follow Nusrat and he wanted to know how will police react to it. Mira comes back home only to be troubled by how angry she was in the video, and thus she ends up contacting the unknown number to know what happened that night. She receives a call from someone saying for a price she can know what happened in the forest. She agrees.
Before the unknown caller contacts back we see Kaur coming down to force her to plead guilty. Kaur explains that all evidence are against her and being a lawyer herself she should confess instead of trying to delaying investigation by bringing up the the psychiatrist. In meantime Kaur gets a call that explains that at time of death Nusrat was pregnant and also that Mira's blood was found nearby. Mira is to be arrested immediately but she requests to bring her medication from the washroom. Once inside Mira panics only to jump from her bathroom window. As the police barge inside the bathroom, Mira is seen escaping unharmed by the fall as she landed on a pile of garbage bags.
She runs and evades the police only to notice she had dropped her phone that got picked by Kaur.
Now on the run, to prove her innocence she meets the guy she saved from trial in start of the movie. She requests him some money, phone and a gun. She uses the gun to threaten Dr Hamid. He explains that Nusrat had called him over because she got to know the same day that she was pregnant but the baby wasn't Anands. He didn't know whose it was but she was texting him and was supposed to meet him that evening to sort it out. To find more clues about this new person who could have potentially murdered Nusrat she sets to the forest. There at the edge of the forest she finds a horse ranch whose owner denies seeing her or Nusrat ever.
Back at police station they find from Mira's phone that someone was extorting her for money. Kaur asks the data to be backed up and the phone be returned to her.
Mira is the station where she is unable to use her pass as its out of balance. When she goes to gets it recharged the technician mentions that her last trip was from High Road to Redford at 8.30 pm. She doubles checks with him before leaving. Meanwhile police know that she has been spotted at the train station and start searching for her. Mira in low profile attends the prayer service for Nusrat, where she notices an altar with her pictures, there she sees a picture of Nusrat's phone and recalls the ranch boy having the same phone. She retrieves Nusrat's phone and sim from the ranch boy. While exiting the station she comes across Shekhar's ex boss Zahra and her husband, she apologizes to them for her behavior. They seem have to no recollection of it, on insistence they tell her that that day at party she felt puckish so she napped in their study, while towards the end of the party She noticed how violent and aggression Shekhar got on Mira. On asked about Shekhar being fired, they tell Mira it had nothing to do with her but because of Shekhar's inappropriate behavior towards a female coworker. Zahra concludes that she was glad when she got to know about the divorce. This comes as a realization to Mira on how all her episodes of rage were tales fed to her by Shekhar and how Shekhar created scenarios, forced her to drink, injured himself or her and made her think that it's her fault.
Shaken to the core by this revelation Mira stops consuming alcohol.
In meantime she gets Nusrat's phone to work only to find that she was having an affair with Shekhar. She goes to High Road station to confirm her doubts and Cctv confirms her presence at the station 8.30 not 10.30. She asks about who provided the tape to the police and gives the technician money to keep her posted on the same. She contacts the PI hired by Anand, he turns out to be the person who was blackmailing Nusrat regarding sending her pics with Shekhar to Anand. He was also present that day in forest and was the one to ask Mira for money. Mira is about to meet the PI Walter when suddenly a car comes at hits him killing him. Before he dies he mumbles something about his house to Mira. Mira grabs Walter's phone and threatens Anand to give her Walter's home address or she will tell the police about him spying on his now late wife. Mira texts someone from Walter's phone saying that proof is at his house.
Once at Walter's house she sees all the prints of her and Shekhar and Nusrat in the forest. She calls Shekhar from Nusrat's phone only to have Anjali picking up and abusing Mira for calling. Once Shekhar comes on phone Mira connects on how all this while he had saved Nusrat's number under her name. She tells him to meet her at Walter's home, as she knew about him being the father.
Shekhar comes and tries to play dumb. To this Mira threatens him with the gun, he finally accepts that he had an affair with Nusrat, they worked at same hospital. They always met in the forest. It was same that day too but Mira came there and confronted Nusrat. Nusrat escaped and ran to him. This made him angry and he hit Mira multiple times finally pushing her on a rock that injured her and made her bleed. Once unconscious he returned to Nusrat. When she told him about her pregnancy and refused to get the baby aborted Shekhar in rage strangled her. She was threatening to get him arrested on the grounds of sexual exploitation.
Concluding the story he offers Mira vodka planning to manipulate her again, this time Mira doesn't fall foe his trap, he requests her to give him Nusrat's phone she agrees only to hit him and knock him unconscious.
Then as a major plot twist it turns out Shekhar hadn't actually murdered Nusrat, as he didn't have a motive to murder Walter. In flashback Mira is seen rummaging through photographs that Walter took only to remember that the car that hit him was same car she had seen before too. On running the license plate it turns out the car belonged to Jimmy Bhalla the culprit of her last court case. He had committed suicide in prison and while searching his images she gets to know that Kaur is his daughter. It was at this moment that Kaur comes in with a gun in her hand. Explanation ensues and Kaur tells that her father was wrongly accused by Mira because of which he died. And post his death she took upon herself to avenge and spoil Mira's life. She was the one who threatened her, crashed her car in the accident. And when she saw one day travelling in train she started shadowing her. That day she was at the forest too, and wanted to murder an unconscious Mira but unfortunately Shekhar hadn't murdered Nusrat, he had barely suffocated her to unconsciousness but panicked about it and had left
While Kaur was trying to murder Mira, Nusrat gained consciousness and saw her in the act. So while Kaur pursued and killed Nusrat, Mira gained consciousness, walked to the nearest station and took the train only to notice Nusrat being chased through the forest. This was her plan to frame Mira.
But Mira concludes saying that she couldn't be framed as she already knew Kaur's role in this as she had received proof from high road station CCTV tech that it was Kauai who bungled the footage timing, and she knew that Kauai had her phone so she intentionally sent the text to her phone from Walter's phone after his death. A fight ensues between them that ends up in Kaur accidentally shooting herself.
Back to present Mira takes Kaur's gun and places it in an unconscious Shekhar's hand to make it look like he murdered her. Police arrests Shekhar and Anjali breaks up with him."

Much of the media coverage is often misinformed or misleading and the general public is still confused about the technology and its larger implications. Join filmmaker Torsten Hoffmann (Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It) on his journey to better understand this decentralised technology and the promise of web3.0.

Can we trust them to build a trustless new cyber utopia or are their projects as unfairly distributed, and easily manipulated as our current systems?"
"Michael is the largest person on board, and Hyperion (the NASA alternative/private space company) is not able to figure out how he got on board, nor how to fix the oxygen scrubber that was permanently damaged by the stowaway's body, he used up extra fuel and oxygen in takeoff that was not planned for, and there are NO replacement parts. Marina asks David to work on increasing his algae project, using up all the resources that were intended for his research project on Mars, to try to produce enough oxygen for even three of them to survive without the scrubber. Concurrently, Marina tries to get Hyperion to come up with a solution (besides offing Michael) and they (with all the world's best minds) can't come up with anything that would allow them to survive the journey. Zoe wants to give Michael extra time while they try to find a solution anyway, David and Marina do not, but they compromise on 10 days, and are ordered to tell Michael nothing. Frustrated at the life threatening risk Michael's presence poses to all the lives of the approved astronauts, David comes up with a lethal injection and offers it to Michael, with an explanation. But Zoe finds Michael, trembling with the injector, and stops him from doing it. She accuses David of not caring, but David (who has a wife at home) has sacrificed ALL of the raw material for his scientific mission for two years in the hope of keeping them all alive, and half of his algae died. He asks what she has done. The other half of the algae dies and there is now only enough oxygen for two people to survive. The commander orders Zoe and David to go out in space (Michael can't physically do it, for lack of training; it does look extremely difficult and something that would take a long time to learn to do well) They try to walk down long cables hooking the main spacecraft to the rocket which launched them off, in the hopes of filling tanks two tanks with remaining liquid oxygen from the launch craft. Each tank can hold liquid oxygen for one person for the whole trip. Zoe succeeds in filling the first tank, and is working on the second tank, but SOLAR STORM! They have to rush back or die from radiation. They rush back and the first tank, which is in no way tethered to Zoe flies off into space just as Zoe and David make it back aboard. The oxygen tank on the launch craft is leaking and Marina says the solar storm will last five hours. Zoe volunteers to go back and fill the second tank. If she succeeds she can save the three remaining astronauts, as she would die due to the radiation. She makes it down, fills it up, brings it back up, then dies of solar radiation.."

"They are transported to Earth-928, Nueva York, a beautiful futuristic world in the year 2099. They enter the Spider Society Headquarters, where Miles sees hundreds of spider people from all different dimensions, including a virtual reality avatar spider-woman named Spider-Byte, controlled remotely by teenager Margo Kess. Confused as to why Gwen told him it was a small group, Miles is given a wristband to prevent him from glitching out. He also sees ""anomalies"", villains displaced from their own dimensions, who are imprisoned in preparation to be sent home by the Go Home Machine, a device that detects the DNA of the anomalies and sends them to the dimension they came from. They are summoned to see Miguel, and Hobie tells Miles to think carefully about why he wants to be a part of the society, warning him to know what he's fighting for before he accepts their methods. Miguel is furious at Gwen and Miles for letting Spot get away, especially at Miles for interfering. He is interrupted by Peter B. Parker, the Spider-Man who helped Miles the previous year, with his infant daughter Mayday. Gwen takes responsibility, saying she should never have gone to see Miles as she was under orders not to get him involved. Miles want to know what's going on, so Miguel decides to explain the situation to him. He shows him an algorithm containing the details of every universe's Spider-Man, and the things that link each and every one of them together, such as the death of a loved one spurring them to heroism. Miguel explains that these are ""canon events"" that are essential to every spider-man's universe. These events cannot be changed, or else they will break the canon, leading to devastating consequences. Miguel explains that he himself broke the canon when he tried to replace a version of himself that was murdered, in order to raise that version of him's daughter. However, his interference caused that dimension and everyone in it to fade into nothing. There are other details that many spider people share and can be tracked by the algorithm, one of which being a police captain close to Spider-Man getting killed while trying to save a child. This death has been experienced by Peter B. and Jess, as well as Hobie. It was supposed to happen to Captain Singh in Mumbatten, but Miles saved him, causing the black energy to appear and threaten to swallow the entire world. Gwen was trying to stop him to preserve the algorithm's canon. Miles realizes that his dad will soon be made a captain, and the vision from Spot showed the villain causing Jefferson's death while trying to save a child. Miguel confirms that according to their projections, Miles' father will die in two days, when he is sworn in. Miles wants to go save him, but Miguel will not allow him to, saying it is a sacrifice that all spider people must make, and insisting that to damage the canon too much would cause every dimension to be eradicated. The other spider people surround Miles and tell him the same, even Peter B. and Gwen refuse to interfere. Miles rejects the notion that the algorithm knows exactly what will happen if he tries to save his dad, so Miguel entraps him in a force cage, intending to hold him until the canon event has played out. Hobie reminds Miles of his venom powers, and Miles breaks out of the cage and runs for it. Hobie looks on proudly before quitting the Spider Society and returning to his own dimension."
"Jaime is held prisoner inside an old island fortress near Cuba, where the OMAC is being developed. Victoria plans to download the Scarab's code into the OMAC neural systems, and duplicate it to create thousands of supersoldiers, unconcerned that the process will likely kill Jaime. Her lead scientist argues that they could learn more from the Scarab if they keep the host alive, but Victoria orders him to start extracting the Scarab's code into Carapax. Meanwhile, Jenny leads the Rayes family to the island, where Nana formulates a plan to storm the base using Kord's old tech.

As he passes out, he sees a vision of Alberto, who encourages him to embrace his destiny and accept the Scarab instead of fighting against it.

The explosion has separated the two girls, and Jenny is captured by Victoria and her guards. Milagro is pinned down, but Jaime finds her just in time. Now completely symbiotic with the Scarab, he easily takes down the soldiers and saves his sister, but is found and engaged by Carapax. A fierce fight ensues, Jaime eventually being beaten down by the bigger, stronger warrior. Rudy emerges and Carapax sends a rocket after him, seemingly killing him. Enraged, Jaime gains the upper hand, and prepares to take revenge for his father and uncle and kill Carapax, but is forceably stopped by the Scarab. Now understanding compassion since merging with Jaime, it tells him what it saw upon being briefly downloaded into Ignacio's own mind, showing that he was conscripted as a child soldier as a young boy, how Victoria found him and took him to be her guinea pig for the OMAC project, and how his mother was killed by a random and senseless bomb attack, turning him into the cold hearted man he became. Jaime takes pity on him, and spares his life. Meanwhile, Victoria attempts to escape in a helicopter with Jenny in tow, showing her that even though if she loses the island facility, she has the Scarab's code in a portable device, and can start over. Jenny uses a protective foam gadget her dad left her to take out the pilots and throw herself and Victoria out of the helicopter to the ground safely. Jenny destroys the duplicated Scarab code, and Victoria orders Carapax to kill them. However, Carapax turns on her as the others escape, reuniting with a very much alive Rudy. Carapax overloads his suit, taking Victoria, the fortress, and all of the OMAC units with him as it explodes."

"Extremely stressed LAPD officer Joe Baylor is working the night shift at a 911 call center, which is overwhelmed with calls relating to a large wildfire in the Hollywood Hills. He is awaiting a hearing for an unspecified incident that occurred on duty eight months ago but hopes to return to his beat afterwards. Joe fields the emergency phone calls while being hounded by a Los Angeles Times reporter asking for a statement about the hearing.
Emily Lighton calls, a young woman who cannot talk freely, and Joe deduces she has been kidnapped and is in a vehicle with her abductor. Learning they are in a white van on the freeway, the driver catches on and Emily has to hang up before providing any further details. Joe relays the information to the CHP, but they are unable to locate the van without more info. He then calls Emily's home phone number, speaking to her young daughter Abby. She tells him her mom was taken by her ex-husband Henry Fisher. Getting Henry's phone number from Abby, he uses it to get the van's license plate number. Relaying the plate number to the CHP, he then sends a LAPD patrol car to check on Abby and her baby brother Oliver. He also requests a search of Henry's apartment, but is denied due to the lack of a warrant.
Joe calls his estranged wife Jess, from whom he has been separated for six months, asking to speak to their daughter Paige, who is asleep. Jess will not agree to come to the hearing and asks Joe to stop calling. He then calls Henry, who has a record of assault, tells him he knows Emily is with him, demands to know where they are headed, but Henry hangs up. Next, Joe calls his ex-partner Rick, who is off-duty, and asks him to check Henry's house. Rick, meant to provide witness testimony at Joe's hearing, expresses concern that things won't go their way as federal agents have been talking to him.
Joe receives a panicked call from Abby and instructs her to open the door for two LAPD officers performing a wellness check. They see Abby has blood on her hands and that her brother Oliver - who she said was ""sleeping"" - is either gravely injured or dead. Rick breaks into Henry's apartment, finding piles of letters and documents. Joe asks him to find information that can help them deduce where Henry is going. Then he calls Emily and convinces her to pull the handbrake, but it fails to crash the van. He calls her back and learns that she is in the back of the van. She tells Joe that she believed Oliver had ""snakes in his stomach"" and that she ""took them out"". When Henry stops the van and tries to remove Emily from the back, she hits him with a brick and runs away.
Rick then calls Joe back and says he found papers in Henry's apartment relating to a psychiatric treatment facility in San Bernardino, where Emily had been a patient. Joe calls Henry, who was taking Emily back to the facility; she had been off her medication for weeks because they could not afford them. When asked why he didn't call the police when Emily hurt Oliver; Henry says he doesn't trust the system as no one was willing to help them before. Joe asks where Emily went, but Henry doesn't know.
Emily calls Joe back from an overpass, implying she is preparing to jump to her death, having realized what she did. He directs the CHP to her location as he talks her down from the bridge. To distract her, Joe reveals that he killed a man while on active duty; when Emily asks why, he says he doesn't know but that he was angry and wanted to punish the man for hurting someone. She asks if it was ""snakes"", and he agrees. Profoundly distraught, Joe tells Emily that her family still loves her and needs her and that he promised Abby she would come home. As officers arrive, Emily says she is ""gonna go be with Oliver"" and hangs up. Joe thinks she has jumped, but the CHP calls to tell him they got her to come down safely. He also learns that Oliver is alive and in the ICU at the hospital.
In the restroom, Joe vomits. He calls Rick, asking him to recant his earlier story and tell the truth on the witness stand even though it means a sentence of years in prison. Joe then calls the L.A. Times, informing the reporter he intends to plead guilty to manslaughter at the trial."

"Detroit based DEA agent Jake Kelly (Armie Hammer) has managed to infiltrate two large scale drug cartels running Fentanyl. One is run by the Armenian Mafia who operate pill mills across the US. The other is based in Montreal, Quebec controlled by drug kingpin Claude 'Mother' Veroche (Guy Nadon), who operates out of a nondescript restaurant called La Marina. Kelly intends to convince the two cartels to enter into business, so both leaders can be arrested at once when they meet. Kelly has personal motivation for bringing them down, due to his younger sister Emmie (Lily-Rose Depp) suffering from crippling heroin addiction. Kelly's relationship with Mother becomes strained when news of Cedric's capture comes to light, with Mother becoming concerned there is an informant in his organizations.
Jake provides a report to his department. He says that the American mafia has recruiters who bring people from the homeless shelters to the clinics which are manned by doctors who prescribe Oxycodone. The recruiters are people who are paid $100 per recruit. The homeless ones have medicare cards and their prescriptions are covered by the govt. The doctors prescribe Oxycodone for any reason what-so-ever. Now the cartels are pushing Fentanyl, which 100 times more potent than heroine. They want to control Fentanyl distribution in the US.
Due to operational funding concerns, Kelly's superior agent Garrett (Michelle Rodriguez) gives him a reduced timescale to organize the meet between the two cartels.
Mother has Cedric killed in police custody for his silence (before he starts taking names), and executes his second in command Guy Broussard (Éric Bruneau) after discovering he has been speaking with the Canadian Mounty Police (Due to his information, the Canadian police was able to intercept the run by Cedric). Mother indicates to Kelly that the bust on the border was impossible without an insider, as it was not a patrolled stretch.
Kelly offers to buy $3 MM worth of Fentanyl from Mother on behalf of the Armenians, to entice Mother to come for the meeting. He knows Mother needs distribution. He tells the Armenians that they can turn the $ 3 MM into $30 MM on the streets easy. He offers to put $ 1 MM from his end, which is later authorized by Garrett."

While the bricks-and-mortar store is doing well enough especially in this Christmas season, they must expand their online presence or risk going under, putting Jen out there online as the creative and thus the face of the brand which Ali is always encouraging her to do, but which Jen, in her lack of confidence, is generally unwilling to do. Ali believes that the Christmas campaign of husband and wife decor influencers Charlie and Zoe of @HyggeAtHome to feature one decorator/designer follower is that perfect opportunity. Jen only needs to submit a video of herself and a design philosophy for Christmas for the first of four elimination rounds; the ultimate winner will be co-branded and offered a job as a resident designer with Hygge for one year. All in an effort solely to gain greater exposure but not necessarily to win, Ali is able to convince Jen to submit that video using the persona of outgoing ""Jen T"" who still leads an imperfect life but who has a perfect back story, complete with loving husband and children, Jen's BFF, photographer Max Faison, as the husband, and Ali and her husband Brad's toddler Reed as that child, who they name Leo Ansel for this online purpose. The video does the trick as their online sales skyrocket overnight. However, the video also gets them further and further into the Hygge competition, as such there an increasing risk that Jen's online persona will be exposed as a fraud with their brand coming crashing down around them if so. What happens is affected by something behind the scenes in Charlie and Zoe's life, by Jen and Ali's outwardly narcissistic mother Liz, whom Jen avoids at all costs, coming back into her life as part of this online ""family"", and by Jen and Max needing to examine their friendship in light of their fake marriage."

Their life is all about adventure which puts front and center their wilder side, and while Zoe often takes that one step further in having a competitive and forthright streak - she a competitive tree climber aspiring to the world championships being held this year in Canada - Tim often shows a more sensitive side in having sympathy crying fits whenever Zoe cries. When Zoe learns that she is pregnant, she is reluctant to tell anyone, most specifically Tim and her best single friend Molly. Beyond fearing losing Molly in believing that parents only tend to hang out with other parents, Zoe, in her rationale, believes that no child is ""planned"", and thus is somewhat unwanted, something that her own parents deny about her, and that she doesn't want being pregnant to change anything about her life, including what she does - she still planning on going to the competition in Canada for which she qualifies - or how people treat her. Tim and the rest of her social circle finding out about her pregnancy doesn't change her mindset, she going as far as lying when necessary so she'll be able to board the plane to Canada. However, Tim goes to the other extreme, not only in wanting to do whatever to protect Zoe and their unborn child at whatever cost, but to ensure that he is the stereotypical perfect father, as he didn't have a supportive father when he was growing up."

Not knowing the reason for the arrest, the girls are submitted to a hard interrogatory including torture to get the confession about they are witches and how it's the ritual of Sabbat. After to learn horrified how Maider is shaved in her head to bald and severely tortured in her body looking for the Satan's seal (a supposedly secret and invisible mark left in the body of a witch that it leaves this part of her body insensitive to any pain), a scary Ana convinces to the rest for inventing all the Sabbat for Rostegui, explaining it as long as be possible, hoping that their fathers comeback in a week during the full moon tide. Discovering the special interest of Rostegui on her, and mixing Basque ancient traditions with popular songs, Ana and the others will use all their imagination to save their lives. But Rostegui starts to suspect if Ana and the rest are in true the witches that suddenly they claim to be and their intention to celebrate Sabbat."
