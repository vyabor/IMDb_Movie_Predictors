"and the Satanic Church that he founded in San Francisco is presented through interviews - with Le Vay himself, congregants including his current (second) wife, Christian religious leaders and people who live in the neighborhood of the church - and sequences of church services. As Le Vay states indirectly that the church was created as a response to the repression of traditional Christian religions, the rituals of the services are steeped in Christian fundamentals.

Mel's sister, Sarah Demerest, knows that Vern will one day settle down to a stable home life with her, she unaware that he and current steady girlfriend, flight attendant Gwen Meighen, the two among the on-board crew of Trans Global Airlines (TGA) ""Golden Argosy"" Flight 2 to Rome this evening, necessarily evaluating their relationship based on some unexpected developments. The snow also focuses more of Mel's attention on work this evening, he and his wife, Cindy Bakersfeld, who are already continually arguing about he placing home second to work. Mel can admit to himself that his excuses not to go home on the best of days is due in part to his relationship with TGA customer service agent, widowed Tanya Livingston, it still at the platonic stage despite their professed attraction to each other. The issues at the airport itself take a back seat upon news from that Rome destined flight. While they knew of chronic Los Angeles residing stowaway, aged Ada Quonsett, on the flight, she always trying to find the most expedient and free way to visit her daughter in New York, which this time includes this flight to Rome, the flight and ground crews have credible suspicions that passenger D.O. Guerrero is packing a bomb in the attaché case he is keeping close to his person. Not wanting to cause a panic, they all have to find a way to make an emergency landing, which, due to the snow, may make Lincoln and runway two-niner the most viable option, that is if they get that far without Guerrero setting off the bomb and if Patroni can clear the runway of the stuck jet."
". He's also wondering what to do about his personal life: does it make sense for him to ""move up"" with his wife Beth and their two daughters from their middle-class lifestyle?

"Gérard (only his currently-assumed name) has been a loyal Communist for most of his life, from being a member of the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War, to working for the French Resistance against the Nazis. During WWII, he was imprisoned in a concentration camp because he was a Jew. His French wife Lise was imprisoned in another camp; she was pregnant, which saved her from immediate execution, and she gave birth to their son there. Now in the early 1950s they are in Czecholovakia; he works as the Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs being a Jew. Although not in the same camp, his French wife, Lise, was also imprisoned in a camp, and gave birth to their son there, being pregnant which was the only thing that saved her from execution. Now in the early 1950s, they are in Czechoslovakia, his post Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs gives them access to perks of the government. He has noticed that he has been openly followed for several days, and while his fellow government officials don't know for sure who is following him, most who were part of the International Brigade have recently been targeted in various ways. Eventually, those tailing him do apprehend and hold him for questioning without official charge. Initially, all he knows is that his captors are with the Soviet regime and want him to confess--but to what? Through interrogation after interrogation interspersed with standard measures of brainwashing, Gérard is falsely accused by his captors as being a Trotskyite, a Titoite, a Zionist, and a traitor against the Soviet Union in working in cahoots with the Americans, who do whatever required to get a confession from him while piecing together signed ""facts"" to use against others who are also being placed under the same interrogation methods. His captors use the non-logical argument that he should confess to these crimes to show his loyalty to the Communist Party. If he does confess, he will admit to crimes which could be punishable by death. As Gérard goes through this process, working hard to stay true to his beliefs, Lise, who believes he will soon be released if he cooperates with the Communists, is being told other things about his incarceration."

"Harry Bailey is two weeks away from getting his Masters degree in Education at a liberally-minded university, after his undergraduate degree in English and English literature, his goal to get a teaching certificate to teach high school English. This goal is a far cry from his renowned student activist days when he was in his undergraduate, his intermediate stint in Vietnam which has given him a view of a more stable future as a real adult. But getting his degree is not a guarantee as he tries to juggle the many facets of his life, including getting enough money not only to pay his tuition, but pay his rent, buy food and keep his broken down car running. Those many priorities lead to him often taking what he considers the most expedient route to reach his end goals, which often means getting friends and colleagues to do work for him, including taking tests, despite he having the academic smarts to pass any of his tests easily if he applied himself. But the conflict in his life that may factor into what he does in these two weeks is that goal of a relatively conservative teaching future, albeit in doing what he thinks is a lofty goal of shaping impressionable young minds, versus the pull by his activist friends on campus to go back into activism as they prepare for one protest after another, many related to student rights.

"A documentary on the Rolling Stones' 1969 US tour and the tragic events that concluded it. We see footage of their concerts and of them making the Sticky Fingers album in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. However, the main focus of the film is on one concert - Altamont Speedway, outside San Francisco, 6 December 1969. A free concert, it is the Stones' idea and it was meant to be the Woodstock of the West (Woodstock having occurred four months earlier). Other bands performing included Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Ike and Tina Turner, Crosby Stills Nash and Young and Santana. However, it is far from being the peace and love of Woodstock. Part of the problem is that the Stones hired the Hells Angels as security. The other problem was that a large portion of the crowd were high on drugs. Friction ensues. During the Stones' set, Meredith Hunter, high on methamphetamine and armed with a gun, makes a lunge for the stage and is stabbed to death by the Hells Angels. The peace and love era of the 60s was over."

The move, which they will do in Joey's brightly painted early model Chevy Impala convertible, is despite some of their friends having done exactly the same thing, only to return back to Cape Breton only after a few months, disillusioned. But their start should be better as Pete has arranged for them to live in his aunt and uncle's place - they who he's never met - and for his friend Anson to help them find jobs. Joey has no expectations about life in Toronto, but Pete believes the world is their oyster - that they can get any job they want just because they're interested in it, and that life will be one exciting adventure after another. Their Toronto start, which doesn't end up as planned, is only marginally more lucrative than it was in Cape Breton.

Jefferson replies, maybe they can tell him how they'll throw the book at him, since that 'book' is in the U.S. and he is in Mexico. El Jefe says his country needs to cooperate with the U.S Government. So Jefferson must fight. Jefferson refuses. He intends to walk right out that door. El Jefe pulls a gun. He will shoot Jefferson if he has to. Jefferson walks towards the door. The door opens. Tick and two Mexican officers carry Eleanor's limp body in. She threw herself down the well. 'Busted her neck.'

Despite their antagonistic beginning, Elgar, after spending time with his tenants and learning their stories, decides to be a proper landlord and fix up the building for them and for him to live in. Elgar's transition into a liberal-minded lover of his black brothers and sisters is not without its problems as he deals with some tenants who are indeed deadbeats, his parents who just don't understand and agree with this phase of his life, and race relations where the color of one's skin does affect how they are treated in life and in turn how they interact with others.

"Seemingly plot-less Let It Be appears as a rambling rag-tag collection of George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr getting together to rehearse material for a new album of songs. As a documentary, showing the artists develop little pieces of music in different ways with phrases of lyrics, piano, guitar and drums shows the indefinable process that culminates to form the Popular Song. As the process continues the overt personalities of the different artists become more prominent and the collaborative spirit that had seemed to be present earlier, dissolves and the character of each member begins to stand out. Paul seems intent on harnessing the talents of each of the members into a unified group to rehearse and find the magic that put the band on the top of the music charts, but the different members have strong independent ideas. Several songs are molded with Lennon and McCartney forging the way, and George toils away on the side with his songs, as Ringo sits in on songs and drums. The film culminates with the band chucking the idea of creating any new cutting edge tunes, and in a moment of public relations grandstanding carry their instruments up onto the roof of Apple Corps headquarters on Saville Row at lunch time on January 30, 1969 to perform, causing the Police to shut down their last public performance."

The next day, Sledge leaves town to meet with the rest of his gang in the hills. He notices the old man from the saloon following him on horseback some distance away. Sledge stops the old man and asks him why he is following behind. The old man explains that he is not following Sledge but rather a convoy escorting a gold shipment. Interested, Sledge takes him at the meeting with his gang. There, the old man explains that while serving a 20 year sentence in the Rockville maximum security prison he learned about the existence of a vault inside the prison where gold is kept overnight. The gold mines in the region ship their gold under heavy armed escort to the prison where the gold sits in the vault overnight until ready to be taken to the gold exchange in the city. The escort is comprised of 40 hand-picked armed guards and the gold wagon is equipped with a manned machine-gun on top of it. Attacking the convoy would surely mean suicide. The old man insists his story is true and that he was imprisoned in a cell adjacent to the bank-like vault deep inside the prison. Only six inches of steel separated him from the gold kept in the vault. At this point, Sledge realizes that attacking the gold shipment and its escort wouldn't be feasible. However, the old man's story gives him the idea of breaking into the vault inside the prison where the gold is stored overnight before being taken to the city. Sledge shares his plan with his gang and reveals his plan to pose as a prisoner in transit being escorted by a marshal to the Rockville prison for an overnight stay until the next day when the marshal would take him to the jurisdiction that posted the wanted bond for Sledge. A member of the gang, Erwin Ward, agrees to impersonate the marshal and Sledge agrees to play the captured outlaw and use his real name since he's wanted for a 5000 dollars reward anyway.

"In Edwardian England, the story of the Waterbury family is told largely from the perspective of the three offspring and by oldest, teenage daughter Bobbie. Their loving and relatively affluent family life in suburban London, financially supported by father Charles' job as a government bureaucrat, includes both parents being a present and welcome part of their children's activities. Their existence is upended when on Christmas evening 1904, Charles is whisked away without warning by two men. Subsequently, the remaining family is forced to move, they renting a rundown and drafty house, Three Chimneys, in the rural village of Oakworth, Yorkshire. While the three children know that they are now poor by their existence, all their Mother has told Bobbie is that Father is not dead, that he will someday return to them when he is able, and for Bobbie and the others not to ask questions about what happened to him. The three are now forced to find a way to occupy their time while Mother tries to earn pocket money by writing and selling stories, many of their activities which are centered on the railway near their house and the railway tunnel a few miles away from the village station. Their life along the railway at least addresses one of the complaints the three had about their life in London, that not much ever happened, which is not the case along the railway as they get into one adventure after another. In the process, they learn to enjoy life in their new situation, which includes the friendship and admiration of many of the villagers in all the Waterburys' inherent kindness and generosity. But the question still remains, at least for the three children, of what happened to Father."

"Some time later, McNally gets a message from Cordona to meet him. The Blackthorne sheriff, Pat Cronin (Bill Williams) tells him Cordona is in the hotel waiting for him. As they are talking, a stagecoach pulls up in the town transporting a woman called Shasta Delaney (Jennifer O' Neill). She tells Pat that there's been a murder in Rio Lobo that was committed by one of the town's sheriff's deputies. Pat insists he can't do anything about it as it's out of his jurisdiction. McNally and Pat go to the hotel to meet Cordona but he's left a message not to be disturbed and they go and sit near Shasta in the bar having a drink. Four deputies arrive from Rio Lobo, including a white haired man called Whitey Carter. They walk into the hotel to arrest Shasta and return her to Rio Lobo. She denies his story and tells Pat that Whitey is the man who killed her friend. Whitey says it was self defense. Pat tells him he's not arresting anyone in his town without a warrant. One of the deputies sneaks in through the back door with a rifle pointing at him. Shasta pulls out a derringer from her bag underneath the table and shoots Whitey. McNally and Pat shoot the other two deputies and the last deputy is just about to shoot McNally when Cordona emerges from his room upstairs with a rifle and saves his life. Cordona recognizes Whitey as one of the men from the war who sold them information. Shasta starts to feel faint after killing Whitey and McNally takes her to Cordona's room to put her to bed. He talks to the stagecoach driver who confirms her story about Whitey killing her friend and her been innocent of murder. Cordona tells McNally that Whitey was working for a rich Yankee but that's all he and Tuscarora have found out. He also tells him that Tuscarora's old friend Phillips is having trouble in Rio Lobo from people who want to take his land away. He's hoping McNally will help him out in return for them helping him and he agrees. Shasta wakes up and offers to go with them as she knows Rio Lobo and knows who to talk to about everything that's going on.
The three of them arrive and sneak into the town late at night. They go to see Tuscarora's girlfriend, Maria (Susana Dosamantes). Maria tells them they can stay with her but they'll have to hide their horses out of view of Sheriff Tom Hendricks (Mike Henry) and his men. Cordona hides them but he notices some deputies patrolling the streets. With nowhere to hide he barges into the home of a woman called Amelita, who is topless at the time. They introduce themselves, she dresses and checks outside and when it's all clear he runs back to Maria's. Cordona thinks they should go to Tuscarora's in the morning but McNally doesn't think they should. If the sheriff and his men are watching the town, he reckons they'll be watching the ranch. Shasta suggests going into town faking a bad tooth to talk to the dentist who is a friend of Tuscarora's and find out what's going on so that Hendricks doesn't get suspicious about a stranger arriving.
Tuscarora arrives in town with a herd of horses he leaves at the stable and goes to the hotel where Maria works to greet her. McNally arrives and keeps his head down to avoid being noticed and witnesses Hendrick's deputies beat Tuscarora up after accusing him of stealing the horses. Maria tries to intervene but she is knocked down. Hendricks comes walking out and tells them to put Tuscarora in jail. Maria is crying and McNally approaches her as a stranger to avoid suspicion and tells her to go inside. He tells Hendricks he's just in town to the see Doc Jones (David Huddleston) about his tooth. Knowing that Hendricks and his men will be watching them through the window of his surgery Doc Jones pretends to remove McNally's tooth while giving him information about what's going on. He tells him that a man called Ketcham (Victor French) is running the town after arriving when the war ended. Hendricks had killed the old sheriff and been given the job by Ketcham. He tells McNally that they will probably use Tuscarora to blackmail Phillips and run off all his stock so that he's trapped inside and threaten to hang Tuscarora unless he sells his land for a quarter of what it's worth.
McNally tells Cordona and Shasta the situation and they go out to Phillips' ranch to try and help him. They knock out the three deputies who are trying to keep him prisoner in his home but are unable to approach the door through fear of been shot by the old man. Shasta goes to see him and he pulls her inside and tells McNally and Cordona to enter with their hands in the air. They explain they are friends of Tuscarora's and are trying to help him get out of jail. Phillips knows Ketcham's ranch well so McNally suggests they go and capture him and use him to bargain with Hendricks to release Tuscarora. They leave Shasta with a friend of Phillips' and go out to sneak into Ketchanm's ranch at night. They quietly take care of his men who are patrolling his home. McNally and Cordona look through the window and Cordona recognizes Ketcham as the traitor who sold them information during the war. It's a Sergeant Major who McNally knew. McNally breaks through the door and gives Ketcham a beating while Cordona and Phillips fire bullets at his men outside to keep them from getting in. McNally beats Ketcham until he agrees to sign over all the deeds he has from all the years of stealing. He agrees after an oil lamp is knocked over and his legs catch fire. They use him as hostage to get away on horseback. McNally realizes that that if they trade Ketcham for Tuscarora Hendricks and his men will just pursue them, capture them and kill them. So instead of trading him, McNally thinks they should order Hendricks and his men to leave the jail so they can join Tuscarora and hold out while Cordona goes to get the cavalry. A deputy arrives at the jail to tell Hendricks what has happened at Phillips' ranch. Hendricks tells his men to guard the main road and prevent anyone from going in or coming out.
McNally goes to Maria's. She's happy that they have Ketcham but Amelita has been attacked by Hendricks. She shows McNally the scar she has down the side of her face from him slicing her in order to get her to tell what she knows. She says she's going to kill him but McNally says he'll do it first. He and Phillips take Ketcham to the jail and tell Hendricks that they'll kill him unless he and his men unarm themselves and leave the office. They lock themselves away in the office and get Tuscarora out of the cell. They sit back and wait for the cavalry but the plan goes wrong when Cordona is ambushed and taken hostage by the deputies guarding the road before he can bring backup.
Doc Jones takes some food to McNally and the others at the office. A deputy delivers a message telling them they have Cordona and they want to trade him for Ketcham. With no other option, McNally agrees to it. He gives Doc Jones the deeds that Ketcham has signed and tells him that no matter what happens the people will get their land back.
The next morning, McNally, Phillips and Tuscarora take Ketcham to do the given exchange point. They meet Doc Jones at a cantina with some of the townspeople who are offering to help them. If Hendricks wins this battle they know they will have their land taken away again. Some of the them hide around the town armed while Tuscarora hides in the water that lays between the cantina and the barn where Hendricks and his men are holding Cordona. McNally shouts for Hendricks to release in return for Ketcham. Ketcham and Cordona start walking towards each other and Tuscarora signals to Cordona from the creek and Cordona jumps into the water. McNally orders Ketcham to stop going any further or he'll shoot him. Hendricks wants him back but McNally tells him he's no use to him as the deeds have been signed over to the people and they are both broke. Hendricks is full of rage and guns Ketcham down. McNally shoots Hendricks in the leg and is shot in the leg himself by one of the deputies. A shootout takes place. It isn't long before Hendrick's men are outgunned. After a failed attempt to blow up the cantina with dynamite the remaining men decide to run out on Hendricks. Hendricks tries to stop them from leaving by firing at them. But after using his rifle as a cane to limp with (barrel side down),its become clogged with mud and when he fires it explodes in his face. He limps to his horse but Amelia appears behind him armed with a rifle. He tries to swing around and shoot her but he's not fast enough and she kills him with two shots. Tuscarora is reunited with Marie and Cordona with Shasta. McNally comforts Amelita and limps off with her with Rio Lobo now free from corruption."

"Special Delivery Kluger - S.D. for short - the postal delivery mail carrier to Santa Claus, is privy to all the questions asked of Santa about him and the Christmas traditions surrounding him. In telling Santa's story from the beginning, S.D. attempts to answer many of those questions, including: why children write to him; how he got the names Santa Claus and Kris Kringle; how he became associated with toy-making elves; why he delivers toys; how he got his distinctive ""ho-ho-ho"" laugh, and the red suit; how he knows who's been naughty or nice; why he comes down the chimney, and why he places some toys in the stockings hung on the fireplace mantle and some under what are now known as Christmas trees; how Santa's reindeer can fly; why he started growing whiskers; who Mrs. Claus is; why they set up their castle and workshop at the North Pole; and why he has devoted his toy giving to the one night of Christmas Eve.

"1789, France. Louis XVI is king, with his queen, Marie Antoinette, at his side, somewhat. Louis summons aristocratic Corsican brothers, ruthless thirty year old twins Philippe and Pierre de Sisi, adept at swordplay, to his court in a matter concerning the arranged marriage of the Duke d'Escargot to Princess Christina of Belgium, the marriage solely for political purposes. Inept Louis is unaware that there are multiple plans underway within his court to use the de Sisis for their own benefit and against him as an internal revolution of sorts is in the works. Did you know that it's 1789 in France? Also underway unknown to those in the court is that a peasant revolt is in the works against Louis, with thirty year old long orphaned and somewhat dim twin brothers Claude and Charles Coupe used as their pawns. Have I mentioned that this takes place in 1789 France? The problem within this collective situation is that Philippe and Claude look exactly alike, and Pierre and Charles look exactly alike, in the four having been born in the same doctor's office at the same time to two different sets of parents, one pair of babies purposefully switched in the doctor and his assistants not remembering which set belonged to which parents, hence hedging their bets at fifty-fifty. Thus, cases of mistaken identity lead to things not quite working out the way anyone thinks or plans. It's 1789 France, did you know?"

Filmed segments include a naked woman stepping out of an elevator; a naked woman hitchhikes on a rural country road; a naked woman appears in a college classroom to each sex education. Other segments include a fully clothed woman begging random men on the street for kisses. Also, an unclad male model converses with two perplexed dowagers, and Funt interviews a prostitute. As a black man and white woman kiss passionately in a bus terminal, passengers in transit are asked their reaction. We also see the reaction of three prude elderly ladies who view a pornographic film, and the climax is an audience reaction to the Funt feature that is shown in a private screening."

The attempts are foiled by Sayid and Sukhov. In the ensuing gunfire most of Abdullah's gang is killed and there is a standoff. Sukhov is forced to leave the cistern top and is pinned but one of Abdullah's men. In the meantime Vereschagin slips away fgrom home, boards and commandeers the boat. Abdullah sends people to eliminate him but Vereschagin gets the better of them. He drives the boat closer to shore to help pinned Sukhov. Sukhov tries to warn him of the dynamite but is unable to.

He is told that the man he killed is the brother of Arch King, a powerful man, who adheres to only one law, his. Later that evening someone breaks into the jail and lets the other man out and shoots him with Harmon's gun. It seems that the other man is also King's brother. Most people think that Harmon shot him but a Mexican boy whom Harmon allowed to sleep on the floor of the jail said that it was two men and that one of them's a soldier. Harmon is then visited by King and is told that unless he can prove that he was not the one who killed his brother, King will be back and will deal with him in his own way. Harmon then rides out to the army fort to tell them that one of their soldiers was one of the men who killed his prisoner. It seems that Harmon is not well received by the army, it seems that years ago, his family was killed and he believes that soldiers were involved, so wherever he is assigned, it's always near an army fort or base."

"as opposed to the man who sold 13 trillion cancer causing cigarettes (who remembers that Nobel was a munitions manufacturer, he who used only a small fraction of his wealth to hand out a Peace Prize?): give $25 million to any town in America that will give up smoking for thirty days. After the laughter from the company executives subsides in the ridiculousness of the scheme, Wren convinces them that no town can meet the eligibility criteria of one hundred percent of its citizens signing up, and even in the remote possibility that any one does, that not all one hundred percent would be able to go cold turkey for thirty days, meaning that this PR stunt to raise Grayson to immortality would cost them virtually nothing. By the entry deadline, one town to Wren's amazement meets the sign up criteria: Eagle Rock, Iowa. It is a town with a population 4,006 and declining as one business and industry after another is leaving town and with them its citizens in it being a depressed town. Rev. Clayton Brooks was the one who spearheaded the initiative in his own self-motivated goal of raising the town's fortunes so that he will be reassigned to the town and church of his choice, preferably more prosperous ones. He was able to convince everyone in town, using one tactic or another, to sign up, even the large percentage of die hard smokers, the toughest case being Dr. Proctor, the town's surgeon. Beyond everyone needing to go cold turkey for the thirty days, the contest brings up some systemic problems within the community, both as a collective and individually. In the latter category is Rev. Brooks' own failings as a husband to his repressed wife, Natalie. Conversely, as there is the possibility that Eagle Rock may actually win the $25 million, Wren takes it upon himself to ensure that it doesn't happen."

"In 1971, Peter Bogdanovich was, perhaps, America's most promising young filmmaker, having directed the remarkable ""Targets"" (1968) and ""The Last Picture Show"" (1971) earning him an Academy Award nomination for the latter. At this point, he chose to make a documentary about legendary film director John Ford. The result was a documentary that drew excellent reviews, following a screening at the 1971 New York Film Festival and a television broadcast. It was later withdrawn from circulation because of legal rights. It was only in early 2006 that Bogdanovich - who was reportedly never totally happy with the 1971 version - went back and revamped the documentary to his satisfaction. He recorded totally new interviews with Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg and incorporated a rare audio recording of Ford and his rumored 'significant other' Katharine Hepburn. He has integrated these new elements alongside the strongest sections from the first version - including extended interviews with Ford and collaborators such as John Wayne, Richard Widmark, James Stewart and Henry Fonda. The result is an entertaining, comprehensive and loving tribute to the man long regarded as one of America's greatest film directors. ""Directed By John Ford"" reminds the viewer that Peter Bogdanovich, along with Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood and Steven Speilberg, is one of our most prominent and respected film historians to whom we all owe a great deal of gratitude."

"In the poor, desolate northern provinces of the mountainous feudal Sunni kingdom of Afghanistan (before the Soviet-engineered republican revolutions), the status of the proud men and their clans is determined less by wealth or even military power (both rare) then by victories in the ancient, though game of buskashi, a vicious form of polo dating back to Genghis Khan, in which the chapendaz (participating horsemen) use their horse-whips on both mounts and rivals in a ruthless fight for a heavy 'ball', a dead calf, which must be carried a long way, almost impossible with all the others mercilessly assailing. Tursen, a former champion, now holds the status of village notable thanks to his position as stable-keeper of the regional lord Osman Bey, and has finally bred a horse without equal, the white stallion Jahil, in time for the royal tournament on the plain of Bagrami, just outside the capital Kabul. As Tursen is too old and has a crooked leg, his son Uraz, even prouder and with a morbidly self-destructive need to prove himself against desperate odds, represents their stable, and after defeating every local adversary it's time to try his luck in Kabul, with a powerful incentive: after victory, he may keep the triumphant horse they cherish above life itself. It's a terribly long, dangerous road across the unforgiving Hindu Kush mountains, and despite a valiant fight Uraz looses the prize and has his leg badly fractured, but decides stubbornly to return home without healing in hospital, so gangrene sets in. His servant, the humble-born groom Mokkhi, is only persuaded to join the quasi-suicidal journey as Jahil is promised to him, but the valuable horse in equally desired by the cheap 'unclean' nomad Zareh whose female charms tempt the men, a deadly combination in itself..."

He will be walking into this day at the hospital which seems to be in equal shambles, his ability to cope not great seeing as to his personal situation. Beyond a demonstration outside the hospital in protest to they developing an adjacent property, the demonstration with which the frazzled Chief of Administrative, Dr. John Sundstrom, will primarily have to deal, a young resident Dr. Howard Schaefer has been discovered dead in one of the hospital beds, in what at first glance looks to be a case of malpractice of the hospital.

But as more medical staff are found dead around the hospital by unusual circumstances, there may more at play this day than initially thought. Through all this chaos, Bock may find some meaning in life in dealing with the case of patient Edward Drummond, who came into the hospital a relatively healthy man, but who has fallen into a coma the result of that staff mismanagement/incompetence. That meaning comes in the form of Drummond's daughter, Barbara Drummond, an RN herself, who wants to take her father back to Mexico where he had been doing missionary work."

John McCabe, who largely lives off what he is able to win in gambling, has just rode into the relatively new mining town of Presbyterian Church, nestled in the mountains of Washington. He is an intimidating figure to most of the men in town, in large part because of his quiet bravado and the belief they have that he is a gunslinger who recently killed a man. With his money, McCabe opens up some businesses catering to the men in town, including a whorehouse and bathhouse, the former which he sets up with a trio of cheap hookers he purchased from nearby Bear Paw. Shortly thereafter, cockney Brit Constance Miller also arrives into town, she, a whore herself, who makes a proposition to McCabe that she run the whorehouse and bathhouse to her exacting high standards on a fifty/fifty partnership basis with him, a proposition which McCabe eventually accepts. Mrs. Miller is able to make a successful go at the businesses despite her penchant for opium, of which McCabe is unaware. The businesses are so successful that the Harrison Shaughnessy mining company sends two of its representatives to Presbyterian Church to buy all McCabe's holdings in town. McCabe turns them down before he learns from much more streetwise Mrs. Miller that there is a steeper price to pay for going against Harrison Shaughnessy. As such, McCabe may have to use those gunslinging skills he purportedly possesses not only to save his and Mrs. Miller's businesses, but his life as well."

"The film covers the last 15 years in the lives of Nicholas (Michael Jayston) and Alexandra (Janet Suzman), the last Czar and Czarina of Russia, and their family. The story starts in 1904 with the birth of Alexei, the last of five children and the only son, who Nicholas and Alexandra see as the continuation of the 300-year-old Romanov dynasty. Global forces seem to be shifting, which threatens that dynasty. Other countries, such as Britain, have a monarchy that is largely symbolic, where the key decisions are made by an elected parliament, unlike the Russian duma, which is under Nicholas' control. Many of Nicholas' decisions have led to poverty and starvation amongst the Russian populace, especially among the working and peasant classes. Those unpopular decisions include the unnecessary war with Japan over Korea; Nicholas wanted an ice-free port in the Pacific, at the price of Russian lives. Many of these decisions are also against the advice of his inner circle of government ministers. There is an uprising of the working class, and Vladimir Lenin (Michael Bryant) has formed the Bolshevik Party under Marxist ideals. Government actions against the working class, sanctioned by Nicholas or not, lead to greater public dissatisfaction with his rule. But the greatest threat to the Romanov dynasty may be Alexandra. Her unpopularity grows through her association with Siberian peasant and self-professed holy man Grigori Rasputin (Tom Baker), who states that he is the voice of God. Alexandra, a highly devout woman, is grasping at anything that will keep hemophiliac Alexei alive. She sees her faith in Father Grigori as the only reason Alexei has survived as long as he has. Her unpopularity increases even more with the onset of World War I, as Russia is at war with Germany and she is from a German background."

In Las Vegas, all of those who were involved have either left town, aren't talking, or are dead. I haven't had a decent night's sleep since all this happened, and now you might find it difficult, too, because there is still one fact that cannot be buried: after the death of Janos Skorzeny, he and all of his victims were immediately cremated. Why? Remember the legend: all those who die from the bite of a vampire will return as a vampire unless destroyed first. So, think about it and try to tell yourself, wherever you may be--in the quiet of your home, in the safety of your bed--try to tell yourself it couldn't happen here."" [Full Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

Desolate and isolated as Australia can be, on holiday after a beer with publican ""Charlie"", he must overnight in ""The Yabba"" (a thinly disguised Broken Hill) before travelling onto his girlfriend and the beaches of Sydney. However the local policeman, Jock Crawford introduces John to the hellish nature of outback pubs, gambling at two-up and the unrelenting heat. Jock explains to John that one of his few duties is to sort out the suicides. Losing all his money and stranded in town, every one he meets has the same paralysing greeting - ""New to the Yabba?"".

"""Punishment Park"" is a pseudo-documentary purporting to be a film crews's news coverage of the team of soldiers escorting a group of hippies, draft dodgers, and anti-establishment types across the desert in a type of capture the flag game. The soldiers vow not to interfere with the rebels' progress and merely shepherd them along to their destination. At that point, having obtained their goal, they will be released. The film crew's coverage is meant to insure that the military's intentions are honorable. As the representatives of the 60's counter-culture get nearer to passing this arbitrary test, the soldiers become increasingly hostile, attempting to force the hippies out of their pacifist behavior. A lot of this film appears improvised and in several scenes real tempers seem to flare as some of the ""acting"" got overaggressive. This is a interesting exercise in situational ethics. The cinéma vérité style, hand-held camera, and ambiguous demands of the director - would the actors be able to maintain their roles given the hazing they were taking - pushed some to the brink. The cast's emotions are clearly on the surface. Unfortunately this film has gone completely underground and is next to impossible to find. It would offer a captivating document of the distrust that existed between soldiers willfully serving in the military and those persons who opposed the war peacefully."

"Pierre is a journalist working on a series of articles relating Brazilian economics to those in Switzerland. His friend, Paul, is a novelist who works as a house painter to make ends meet. When the financially strapped Pierre pursues a paying assignment from Swiss television to write a script about a shooting incident several years back, he enlists Paul's help to complete everything in the needed one-month time frame. The incident offers some intrigue: a man is shot while cleaning his army rifle. He says his delinquent niece, Rosemonde, shot him, while she claims he accidentally shot himself. The truth is never determined and Rosemonde is not charged.
Pierre pursues the assignment like a journalist, reviewing the shooting scene and interviewing the uncle, the niece's former employers and friends, and eventually Rosemonde herself. Paul recreates the incident, applying his imagination alone to construct the details of the plot and the players while continuing at home with his poet wife and young daughter. They plan to work independently and pool their material to create the final script. Uncannily, Paul intuits a lot of the details of events and persons correctly without knowing the facts, while we observe Pierre running the facts down. He develops a relationship with Rosemonde, who enters his life and his bed. Paul meets Rosemonde at Pierre's and also falls under her spell. He concocts a tale in which he appears to tell his wife he has been unfaithful and she responds by quoting a passage from Handke that speaks to a future where people will be free to live and love as they like without hurting each other.
Meeting the actual Rosemonde destroys Paul's ability to work on her story, while Pierre has only his notes to fall back on. The deadline passes, they cannot deliver the script, and they have already spent the fee, defraying old debts and helping Rosemonde. Officialdom imposes as an inspector arrives to evaluate the contents of Pierre's apartment since the rent has not been paid for months. Pierre faces poverty and eviction and decides to relocate to Paris while Paul returns to house painting, but their friendship continues strong. We watch Rosemonde defy her petit bourgeois bosses, first leaving her sausage factory job and subsequently getting herself fired from a shoe shop after she is implicated in a burglary there. She walks away smiling into the Christmas shopping crowds. At least for these few minutes, she is free."

He then has to flee the burgomaster's men by jumping out a window into a coach. The runaway vehicle drops him at the tavern and, after a disagreeable argument with the landlord, he leaves on foot and winds up at Castle Dracula looking for overnight lodging. Instead, he is seduced by the mysterious Tanya [Anouska Hempel], who is a victim of the count but not fully a vampire. Before dawn, she bares her fangs and prepares to claim Paul as a victim, but Dracula interferes, knocking Paul unconscious and viciously stabbing Tanya to death. Paul regains consciousness at the cock's crow and covers the carnage with a bed sheet and fashions a makeshift rope to scale the castle wall and gain access to the floor below. The sheets are pulled back up by Klove, leaving Paul trapped in Dracula's crypt to await dusk."

John Landis plays the part of Schlock and although expressing emotions through a monkey suit is not easy - he gets the point across."

"John Shaft is a Black private detective working in downtown New York City. He learns the hard way that Bumpy Jonas, a Harlem-based Black mobster, wants to hire him to locate his daughter, Marcy Jonas, whom Bumpy claims was kidnapped, there being no ransom note. All Bumpy can tell Shaft is that he believes that a mid-level Harlem Black thug named Ben Buford, who is known now to be lying low, is either behind the kidnapping or knows something about it. Because of his criminal history, Bumpy can't go to the police for their help, and he chooses Shaft because he has his hands on the pulse of both the Black and the white communities in inner-city New York. Despite not liking the way that Bumpy contacted him, Shaft agrees to the job in part because he can see that Bumpy has true concern for his daughter, a probable innocent in the matter. Even before having the conversation with Bumpy, Shaft is contacted by NYPD Lieutenant Vic Androzzi--with whom he has a love/hate relationship--who wants Shaft to tell him what he knows about what's going on with Bumpy, if only to prepare for any potential bloodshed that might be happening down the pike.

Ultimately, Shaft gets caught in the middle in a war of Bumpy's mob gang and the Italian Mafia.

", the Ambassador and his security detail of two samurai who are in their own private car. As such, one of the unexpected treasures the bandits is able to obtain is a ceremonial Japanese sword which was meant as a gift from the Japanese government to the President. But in the bandits' getaway, Link is double crossed by Gauche, who mistakenly assumes Link is killed in the ensuing melee. So Gauche now becomes the common enemy for both Link and the Ambassador, who is able to convince a reluctant Link to allow one of his samurai, Kuroda Jubie, to accompany him to locate Gauche and the loot. Although Gauche is a common enemy, the missions for Link and Kuroda are somewhat incompatible, as Link knows the samurai solely wants to kill Gauche to retrieve the sword, while Link has to get the information of the location of the loot from Gauche before he is killed. Also Link and Kuroda are working on different motives and different sensibilities, Link's motive which is largely monetary, while Kuroda's is solely honor, not being able to retrieve the sword which would mean dishonor and needing to go through the ritual of harakiri for eternal redemption. Although Kuroda is more than capable of taking care of himself, perhaps even more so than Link, he is still a fish out of water, and requires Link's knowledge of Gauche and the region to find him. Part of that knowledge is Cristina, Gauche's prostitute girlfriend who they may need to turn to find him. Beyond finding Gauche and trying to overcome their own differences, Link and Kuroda may have other natural obstacles of the region, namely other enemies not yet in the picture such as other bandits or marauding Comanches."

"Despite or because of the state of the Revolutionary War led by General George Washington, the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, has long skirted the issue of independence from Great Britain, much to the chagrin of its chief proponents, Massachusetts Congressman John Adams and Pennsylvania Congressman Dr. Benjamin Franklin. Adams knows that much of the debate is against him as a person, many who see him as being obnoxious and a blow-hard. He decides a more judicious approach may be to work behind the scenes rather than be front and center in the fight as he has been. On June 7, 1776, Adams gets Virginia Congressman Richard Henry Lee to propose a motion in Congress to debate the issue, which finally passes. However when the vote for independence finally looks like it will pass, its chief opponent, Pennsylvania Congressman John Dickinson, manages to pass a motion that any vote for independence needs to be unanimous. As a delay tactic, Adams initiates a successful motion to postpone the vote for three weeks to July 2, 1776 until they can vote on the actual text for a declaration of independence - his assertion is how can they vote on something that does not exist. Adams and Franklin talk a reluctant Virginia Congressman Thomas Jefferson to be the one to draft the document. Jefferson's reluctance is that he has other more personal issues on his mind. As Jefferson takes to his writing duties, Adams and Franklin and their supporters know they only have three weeks to convince the six opposing colonies to support independence. As Franklin states, it may take some improvisation and some compromise."

By the body count at one site - three black men, and two white men - plus one black and one white police officer killed in pursuit, the NYPD believes that at the core of the crime is the Italian mafia. Indeed, three black men - Jimmy Harris, Joe Logart and Henry Jackson - the former two masquerading as police officers, the latter the getaway driver, were able to rob the mafia's Harlem operation of $300,000, and although they walked into the operation not intending on any violence, the seven dead bodies was the final outcome. As the NYPD investigates the crime and the mafia embarks on getting their money back while showing the crooks in no uncertain terms that they will never be able to get away with it, the conflicts are not relegated to just between the three groups, but also within the NYPD and the mafia in the racially charged environment that is Harlem.

And Doc Johnson, the black lead of organized crime in the neighborhood, has no respect for who the mafia sends to lead the clean up, Nick D'Salvio, who Johnson taunts as only having gotten to his position by marrying the boss' daughter, while D'Salvio in return goes to extremes to prove Johnson wrong."

"After the American Civil War, many freed slaves head out West in search of free land and a better life. Former slave and Union Army sergeant Buck becomes a self-employed wagon master to wagon trains of freed slaves heading West. Buck knows the region well and he charges fair wages from the wagon trains employing him. He also has a working relationship with the local Indian tribes that charge trespassing fees from the wagon trains heading West across Indian lands. In return, they allow the settlers to move across Indian territory unhindered and to hunt a few buffalo needed to feed the wagon-train settlers. However, not everyone in the region is friendly toward the westward-traveling Black settlers. Owners of Southern plantations, dismayed by the loss of slave manpower that previously worked the plantations for free, hire band of white rogues and outlaws to prevent former Black slaves from going West. In order to achieve this aim, the hired bands of rogues attack wagon trains and destroy the wagons, the supplies and the food resources of the former slaves. They threaten the Black settlers with harm and they tell them to return to the Southern states where they came from and work the plantations. Wagonmaster Buck encourages the freed slaves to continue their trek westward and to not give up their dream of settling in the West. Knowing this, the band of rogues led by DeShay plans to capture and kill Buck. The DeShay gang sets up ambushes and traps but Buck always manages to avoid capture. The gang resides in the town of Copper Springs where the sheriff, an honest man, doesn't agree with the gang's ruthless tactics against wagon trains of freed slaves. Chased by the DeShay bunch, wagon master Buck and his tired horse arrive at a river where a Black preacher, Reverend Willis Oakes Rutherford, is bathing. Desperate, Buck switches horses with the preacher against his will, and rides off to meet his wagon train. The preacher heads to Copper Springs where he bumps into DeShay's gang. Recognising Buck's horse, the gang interrogates the preacher about Buck's whereabouts. DeShay promises a $500 reward to the preacher if he finds Buck and captures or kills him. DeShay also instructs the preacher to convince all Black settlers to turn back East toward the Southern plantations and abandon their westward trek. The preacher agrees with DeShay and leaves town. Outside town he meets a wagon train formed of freed slaves and led by none other than Buck. After an angry exchange between the preacher and Buck, the preacher joins the wagon train. During the following days of travel, the preacher notices that all the money of the wagon train is kept in a money belt one of the women carries around her waist. A few days later, a distrustful Buck orders the preacher to leave the wagon train and he himself rides away to scout the area and to pay in cash a right of passage to the local Indian tribe in behalf of the trespassing wagon train. The preacher follows Buck and he witnesses the payment made by Buck to the Indian chief for safe passage of the settlers. When Buck, followed by the preacher, returns to the wagon train, a gruesome scene awaits. DeShay's gang attacked the wagon train, stole the settlers' money, destroyed their food and supplies and even killed a few settlers. Heartbroken, the surviving settlers want to turn back but Buck encourages them to go on. Angry at the devastation, Buck and the preacher decide to ride to the town of Copper Springs and exact revenge on DeShay's gang and also try to retrieve the money DeShay stole from the Black settlers. There are only two against many, but those two are determined to succeed."

"Handsome Bill McKay is not his father's son, his father being former California Governor, John J. McKay. An idealistic civil rights lawyer, Bill believes the political process is all style over substance, and thus he can accomplish more for the people, many of those disenfranchised, in his role as lawyer than politician. For the upcoming midterm election, Bill is approached by strategist Marvin Lucas to contest the Democratic nomination for the California senate seat, the actual election against wildly popular Republican incumbent, Crocker Jarmon. Marvin is able to sell Bill, with his supportive wife Nancy at his side, on the idea as he can easily win the nomination, but has no chance of winning the actual election against Jarmon and thus he can freely speak his mind to the California electorate. Bill's biggest condition is that his father not be involved at all, Bill not wanting his father's legacy to overshadow any of his own messages. Unfortunately for Bill, McKay Sr. may influence Bill's campaign whether or not he is directly involved. What Bill did not account for is that he has to make a credible showing or else his own reputation as a human being may be in jeopardy. So as the polls continually change for the good or bad for Bill, he may buckle under the pressure to become what he didn't want to be in the first place. His entire life, including his marriage, may also be totally taken over by the campaign process until election day."

"Long before faith-based films became a regular feature of mainstream movie theaters, there was ""The Cross and The Switchblade."" The film was made squarely within the Hollywood system, yet was set apart by its producers' unashamedly Christian vision. It went on to become a worldwide ministry phenomenon and it stands among the early sparks that ignited today's growing Christian film movement. Based on David Wilkerson's same-titled 1963 autobiography, the film depicts the unlikely efforts of a ""skinny country preacher"" to bring change to the desperate lives of gang members living and dying on the mean streets of New York City. Among those whose lives were transformed was notorious gang-leader Nicky Cruz who went on to lead a decades-long outreach to gang members and other distressed young people. Wilkerson's mission to tell lost and hurting young people that there was a better way through Jesus Christ, blossomed into the Times Square Church and the international ministry of World Challenge whose mission is to bring lasting holistic change to individuals and communities. Although this 1970 film bears the style of a different era, the life-changing solution that David Wilkerson brought to desperate lives remains forever relevant. And 50 years later, for all its retro elements the film still stands up to scrutiny as a well-written, stylishly-produced movie featuring sincerely passionate performances. The story lives on in the book, in this film, but more importantly in the legacy of lives transformed by the message that no one is ever so far gone that they cannot find the way home."

Concurrently, research scientist Dr. Henry Jekyll feels compelled to document anecdotally his latest research in case something happens to him. A virologist working on an antidote to cure a number of viruses, he decides to change his field of research on an off the cuff comment by friend and mentor, Professor Robertson, saying that such a cure-all would take years to develop, longer than Dr. Jekyll's lifespan. So Jekyll changes his research to finding the answer to eternal life so that he can live long enough to cure the world of its viruses. In early experiments, he narrows his research to the differences between the sexes and that females have a longer lifespan than males, early experiments on insects increasing that lifespan of males by a factor of three. The two problems are: he needing female organs to advance his research to humans, and exhausting the supply of deceased females in morgues, he turns to killing himself for the greater good, hence he being the Whitechapel Murderer; and that he has no human subject, so uses himself as that subject. With that latter issue, he discovers that his use of the serum changes his being to a female, who he is passing off as his widowed sister, Mrs. Hyde. That transformation initially helps his cause as Mrs. Hyde takes over the murders. But as the Spencers, who live above him, become more ensconced in his life - Howard Spencer who is attracted to Mrs. Hyde, and innocent Susan Spencer having long pined for Dr. Jekyll - things become more complex as Dr. Jekyll and cold-blooded Mrs. Hyde battle for control of his being, Mrs. Hyde who could choose Susan as her next victim."

"Adapted from a story by Truman Capote (""In Cold Blood""), the world of the prison convict is open to the viewer. As the story develops, one thing becomes clear. As in the outside world, there is a ""system""; and just as on the outside, there is accommodation, honesty, cynicism, violence and all the other factors that make up our society. Three new convicts act as the catalyst for the events that follow; a college teacher, convicted of accidental manslaughter; a young man, sentenced for possession of marijuana; a new guard, interested in changing the system. Inside prison, the 'establlishment' presents itself. The warden doesn't want to rock the boat of the small society within prison walls. A convict dictator controls activities among the inmates thanks to a control of the narcotics traffic. A leader of the black convicts seethes in his own world of racial tension when there is no difference between convicts and authorities. As the film follows the three newcomers, it records the grim, terrifying, sometimes fascinating events that occur."

"), who is being backed by the rival Tattaglia family. He asks Don Corleone for financing as well as political and legal protection for importing and distributing heroin. Despite the huge profit to be made, Vito Corleone refuses, explaining that his political influence would be jeopardized by a move into the narcotics trade -- the judges and politicians he's allied himself with over the course of several decades would renounce their friendships with him if he were to enter the drug trade. The Don's eldest son, Sonny, who had earlier urged the family to enter the narcotics trade, breaks rank during the meeting and begins to question Sollozzo's assurances as to the Corleone Family's investment being guaranteed by the Tattaglia Family.

Wermeer is holed up in the small mining town of Gila Bend by a swarm of bounty killers, who want his $3,000 reward, posted by Saxon's three sons David, Eli and Adam. A sheriff named Clayton (Lee Van Cleef) arrives on a stagecoach and bosses his way through the cordon set up by the local lawmen. While walking to the saloon, he performs actions that tip off Wermeer as to where some of the besiegers are hidden (like throwing a lit match so a man hidden in a haystack has to put it out). Wermeer makes it to the saloon, where Clayton, who has counted Wermeer's shots and knows that he is out of bullets, arrests him. Holk, a spokesman for the bounty killers, calls on Wermeer to surrender. A shot rings out and Clayton emerges dragging the ""dead"" convict. They argue that Clayton is a sheriff and therefore he cannot collect bounty, and that he instead should give up the body. The disagreement develops into a gunfight. Wermeer jumps up on a horse and escapes, pursued by the pack (though not Clayton). Wermeer makes the bounty hunters follow his horse, then hitches a ride with the stagecoach, where he finds Clayton among the passengers."

"In 1876, the Missouri legislature issues a pardon and amnesty to the James and Younger gangs despite many people considering them outlaws. The pardon is because they protected the homesteaders of Clay County against the marauding railroaders, who wouldn't let anyone or anything get in their way of building the railroad where they wanted.

Largely bedridden, he believes that Elizabeth is slowly poisoning him to death and he wants the girls to stop her in any way they can, including killing her if need be. Elizabeth is unaware of the true reason why Benjamin has convened his daughters at this time. His belief is partly due to the fact that Elizabeth was charged but acquitted of the murder of her first husband, he who died from what is officially listed as suicide from self-induced poisoning.

It then becomes clear to some that Elizabeth is not only trying to kill Benjamin, but them as well. Or are there other factors in play for the potentially deadly occurrences on the Morgan property as Benjamin, Elizabeth and the girls are stranded there together?"

Due largely to an incident which nearly kills him, outlaw Roy Bean appoints himself the judge for the region, he setting up his residence and court in what was previously the saloon and whorehouse in town. He figures he has the moral authority and knowledge of the laws of Texas to become a judge in what was his flagrant disregard of those laws up to this point.

Standing by him through these proceedings is a young Mexican woman named Maria Elena, who saved him from that near death incident, she, in what is to look proper, living in the small shack next to the saloon instead of with him in the saloon.

"In a prosperous small provincial town in Southern Italy, a naked woman is discovered murdered and mutilated. By her body are a number of photographs of her having sex with her lover, his face having been cut out. At the morgue, the chief pathologist suggests to the detective in charge of the case, Inspector Capuano, that the victim was killed almost instantly by a from an open blade razor to the neck, the subsequent blows being the result of a homicidal fury. A fellow police officer is of the opinion that, due to the circumstances surrounding the murder, especially the presence of the photographs, they are dealing with a maniac. Capuano considers having the pictures of the lover blown up so that all his physical details can be logged, but rejects the idea as impractical, not least because the victims husband is a general with very powerful political connections, meaning that any investigation must be handled very delicately. It is decided in the meantime to arrest members of the local criminal fraternity and determine any links, no matter how tenuous, with the case. Despite intensive questioning of suspects, no new information is yielded and so Capuano returns home to his wife. She is worried about the effect his latest investigation is having on him, while he complains about the wall of silence surrounding the case, meaning that he cannot perform his duties properly.

The next morning her boyfriend is reassured by his lawyer that he has nothing to fear from the resulting police investigation, since his face had been removed from the photos. He is advised that because of the victims powerful husband, the police will not pursue the case too forcefully and that he should continue with his life as normal. Detective Capulano and the pathologist discuss the connection between the two murders and mull over possible motives for the crimes, including jealousy and psychosis brought about by impotence or homosexual rage. The detective hears strange laughter coming from the morgue and is taken inside by the pathologist. There they encounter, Gastoni, the morgue assistant who takes a strong pride in his work as an embalmer and whose laughter is the result of perfectly restoring a corpses former beauty.

"pays homage to his adopted hometown of Rome through the presentation of a series of vignettes. Many of those vignettes are autobiographical, relating to his own early memories of Rome, from incidents at school, watching a movie at the cinema, a visit to the city when he was 18 and stayed with the Palletta family, attending a provincial theater performance, and visits to different types of brothels. He provides a view of the experience of people just arriving to the city for the first time via the highways into the city. During present day, he shows the dichotomy between Rome's rich artistic and religious history against the modernism occurring in different facets. And he celebrates the people, whether they be longtime residents, people who came never to leave, or those just passing through."

"Following Lord Ralph Gurney's accidental death, his son Jack Gurney inherits his estate including his title, the Earl of Gurney. Jack has been away for seven years during which he had no contact with his extended family. He believes he was in a monastery, but he was actually in a psychiatric hospital as a voluntary patient at his father's request; as a paranoid schizophrenic, he believes that he is Jesus Christ. In leading a movement for eternal love, the latter issue of all men being equal might be more problematic for his family, who are part of the so-called ruling class, than his belief that, in his own words, when he prays to God he hears himself; any of life's problems he places inside his ""galvanized pressure cooker."" His paternal uncle and his family are the most concerned about Jack taking over the peerage and the vast estate, and what that would do to the historic Gurney name. Competing interests in the family work toward two opposing possible options to deal with the situation: to have anyone that they can manipulate with a Gurney name take over, at which time they can recommit him for good; or to see if his long-time psychiatrist at the hospital, Dr. Herder, can get him to face reality. Jack may, however, throw them all for a loop."

"Global Airways domestic flight 502 to Minneapolis-St. Paul has the potential for issues when Angie Thatcher, the girlfriend of co-pilot Sam Allen, is reassigned as lead flight attendant, those issues as she is also the ex-girlfriend of the pilot, Hank O'Hara. There is further excitement once in the air as the President of the United States relays a message for one of the passengers. But those two issues take a back seat when a note for one person obviously to find states that there is a bomb aboard the plane and the note writer will detonate said bomb unless the flight is diverted to Anchorage, Alaska. The location of the note means that it had to have been written by one of the passengers in first class: a jazz cellist off to a gig; an army sergeant on furlough to attend his sister's wedding; a US Senator and his young adult son off on a fishing trip together; a young female hippie; a pregnant woman nearing the end of her third trimester, she traveling without her husband; and a couple past middle age on their latest move due to yet another work transfer, which the husband views as ""losing"". The flight crew has to view everyone as a suspect in taking whatever each says with a grain of salt. But even if they are able to discover the identity of the hijacker and his/her motivation and end goal, they still have to find and defuse the bomb."

"Using his own terminology, Billy Pilgrim is ""unstuck in time"", which means he is moving between different points in his life uncontrollably, although he is aware of it at certain of those points as witnessed by the letter to the editor he writes to the Ilium Daily News about his situation. Primarily, he is moving between three general time periods and locations. The first is his stint as a GI during WWII, when, as a pacifist, he was acting as a Chaplain's assistant for his unit. This time is largely as a POW, where he was in Dresden the day of the bombing, spending it with among others an older compassionate GI named Edgar Derby, and a brash loudmouth GI named Paul Lazzaro. The second is his life as an optometrist in Ilium in upstate New York, eventually married to the wealthy and overbearing Valencia Merble, and having two offspring, Robert, who would spend his teen-aged years as a semi-delinquent, and Barbara, who would end up much like her mother. And the third is as an abductee on the planet Tralfamadore, along with his devoted dog Spot, and Hollywood starlet Montana Wildhack - who was not averse to taking off her clothes to further her career - the Tralfamadorians who have put them on display. The more time he spends on Tralfamadore, the more he understands the meaning of what is happening to him."

Wyke states that he did not really kill Tindle but had used blank bullets. His aim was to humiliate the man and teach him that becoming a member of the gentry requires breeding rather than just joining in. He maintains that, after recovering from the shock, Tindle left the house alive."

Not knowing who Lila is, Charlie Brown and his friends each believe that Snoopy left as he has been unhappy in a disagreement with many of them. Regardless, Charlie Brown is determined to find out who Lila is and to do whatever required to get Snoopy back home. If Charlie Brown discovers the truth, he will indeed discover that Snoopy has been increasingly unhappy, more so in that many of the places he likes to frequent have become ""no dogs allowed"", but his hasty departure is more to comfort a friend in need, Lila his owner before she had to give him up, then when he was sent to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm for adoption. Beyond Snoopy and Woodstock's misadventures en route to the hospital, Snoopy will have to figure out where his allegiances and heart lie when Lila tells him that, upon her imminent release from the hospital, she'd like him back for good."
"Struggling emotionally and financially in a dead-end job as an accounting clerk at a New York City insurance company, John Baxter chucks the job and the New York life and uproots his family--wife Sue and teenage children Chris and Richard Baxter, all figuratively kicking and screaming--when he inherits what seems to be the lucrative 25-room Grand Imperial Hotel in the mountains of Silver Hill, Colorado. What they find upon arrival in Silver Hill in the middle of winter is a boarded-up, dilapidated building that last made good money during the mining era. They also find that they've inherited--officially or not--some of the town's misfits. They've spent all their money on legal fees and moving, so have no cash to make even the most basic repairs. But when John learns that he not only owns the building but much of the adjacent mountainside, he believes the answer to their problems is to turn the hotel into a ski lodge and develop the mountain into a ski run. Having no experience whatsoever with winter alpine recreation, John gets into one misadventure after another. A further hurdle is Martin Ridgeway, the local banker, who tries to thwart John at every turn in his goal to purchase the hotel. The unknown reason why Ridgeway wants the hotel so badly might be the answer to all John's problems."
"In the library, everyone is waiting for Snaut. Sartorius, who is immersed in his books, says Snaut may be delayed due to more Visitors. Snaut arrives an hour and a half late, much to Sartorius' chagrin, and once again makes a very incoherent impression. He hands Chris a book from a pile for him to read out loud, while giving Hari a kiss on her hand. It is an excerpt from Don Quixote, where Sancho praises the blessings of sleep. Sartorius proposes a toast to Snaut's courage and devotion to science. Snaut responds that science is a fraud, and claims their present scientific problem won't be solved. He says mankind has no ambition to conquer the cosmos; Man simply wants to extend Earth's borders, wanting no others worlds, but only mirrors to see his own in. Attempts at contact with extraterrestrials is doomed to fail, as the goal is one mankind fears and does not need: ""Man needs Man"", he concludes. Instead, he proposes a toast to Gibarian, who was fearful. Chris does not agree, stating that he thinks Gibarian committed suicide because he thought he was alone in what happened to him, seeing no other way out. Sartorius counters this, claiming that nature created Man to gain knowledge in search of truth; he criticizes Chris for only showing interest in lying in bed with his ex-wife all day, and Gibarian for being contemptible. Snaut quickly quells the argument. Hari is visibly disturbed by the exchange of words; she claims that Chris is the only one displaying some humanity under inhumane conditions, whereas the other two do not seem to care and regard their Visitors as external enemies. She claims the Visitors are their conscience, and Chris may indeed love her, or show a humane reaction at the very least, unlike the others, who she resents. Sartorius becomes confrontational again, questioning her right of existence, as the real Hari is dead and she is a mere reproduction or copy. Hari acknowledges this, but says she is becoming human; she can feel and love, and can exist independent from Chris. She walks away, hurt by Sartorius' cruel words, and knocks over a chandelier. She tries to take a drink, but cannot swallow it, breaking down in tears. Chris tries to comforts her, much to Sartorius' disgust, who leaves. Snaut says that all the quarreling makes them loose their humanity and dignity. In tears, Hari says that each of them is human in his own way, and thats why they quarrel. Chris thanks Snaut for his continuing kindness. Snaut is inebriated; he says he is completely worn out and starts a walk with Chris. He says that he is entitled to get drunk for all the sacrifices he has made for the mission. He likens Sartorius with Faust, as he is seeking a way against immortality. They walk through the station, Snaut singing and talking gibberish about communicating with the planet. Chris wants to return as he left Hari alone in the library. Snaut warns him that the station is shifting orbit, so there will be 30 seconds of weightlessness at 1700 hours."
"Sandy Dennis, Darren McGavin, and their kids move into a possessed Pennsylvania farmhouse occupied by the devil himself, eager to assert his powers on new tenants. This early Steven Speilberg TV movie comes on the heels of his classic ""Duel"" and shares some similarities with his later production, ""Poltergeist"". Speilberg's camera trickery makes this entry much better than the usual made-for-TV ghost-story movie at the time and the director even makes a cameo appearance."

The first called in the lab is Simone, who comes out of the lab shaky, and not telling a word. The second in is Sugar, who the doctor straps down on an examining table, aided by Wolfgang. He wires her up with electrodes and then pulls out a syringe. ""This is used in fertility rituals and as a cure for frigidity."" Sugar starts moaning and groaning.

Karin and Maria's return is despite the three sisters having an unspoken strained and standoffish relationship with each other. Cold and stern Karin is all repressed emotions as she hides behind a proper decorum, those repressed emotions including a hatred for her diplomat husband, Fredrik.

Bodicia elected to go in on the left side, exposing herself to the trident, rather than the net, and Mamawi had assumed the contrary, usual escape. Therefore she threw her net to the right, too far, and lost it. She promptly beats the shield away from Bodicia's left wrist, with a strong downward stroke of the trident. The women face each other without protective weapons either than their sandals, leather belts, and Mamawi's left arm chain mail. The blonde attacks in despair, and the Nubian is forced to her knees. The peaceful priestess, in the heat of the battle, disengages her gladius and strikes to the black woman's chest, but Mamawi strikes low with the pole hand of the trident and the blonde stumbles back, hurt. The black panther is swiftly up and goes after the blonde, who trips and defends three successive attacks with her gladius, until her hurt wrist can't hold her bronze blade any longer, and she loses her weapon. She ramps back on her rump, looking up at the savage Nubian, until she has her back against the wall - like Marcus in his last fight. There is no pleading in her eyes, only resignation. There is no scorn in the black woman's eyes, only rage and frustration, as she presses the tridents' deadly fork to her opponent's chest."

"Just as Babita's contact with the natural forces signifies a sympathy and understanding of the other sufferers, the grotesque halfburned, half-normal face of the kiln worker exaggerates his isolation and separateness from the rest of society. He has too much face. To comprehend his place in the life of the community and move closer to its creative center, the Brahmin must humble himself and undergo a loss of face. We see his metamorphosis as Ray builds silhouettes against a vast sky. The first silhouette is that of the old beggar man who asks the Brahmin for food. Later, as he realizes his false dependence on the peasants, the Brahmin undergoes his loss of face and he too appears in silhouette. Throughout the film we find small forms outlined against a large background until the final climactic and powerful image of a community joined together against a disaster manufactured by an individual act somewhere in the distance."

"The Iron Guard, also known as Legion of Archangel Michael, was a Romanian nationalist and patriotic movement of extreme right; as such, after it rose to power, it supported Nazi Germany and started a fierce campaign of retaliation against its political enemies.

However, Moldovan has communist sympathies, so he quickly comes under the influence of the Bolshevik Pîrvu, who had escaped during the Viraga massacre, only to be later apprehended again by the police. Pîrvu being an old friend and work mate of Moldovan's father, he feeds to the commissioner all the well-known soviet propaganda, during the interrogatories. Thus gained on the left side, Moldovan turns against the Iron Guards, in a short time gathering enough evidence to close the case. Hearing about this, the Iron Guard Senator Naumescu (Nae Ionescu) tries to bribe Moldovan - but the commissioner only accepts the money (one briefcase containing half a million lei, worth his salary for ten years) to use it for financing the communist party. He then delivers the file to the ""Universul"" newspaper, but the Legionnaire commissioner Paraipan, his arch enemy, retrieves it before going into print. Learning this, Naumescu orders Moldovan's dispatching. After a long and noisy series of shootouts and street action, Moldovan gradually shoots eight out of the new members of Paraipan's team, sparing only Tänäsescu, who had been assigned as his assistant during the investigation. Loyal to the cause, Tänäsescu informs Naumescu about Moldovan's whereabouts - so the Senator lays a trap for the commissioner, using Tänäsescu as bait. At the height of an unequal confrontation, in the heart of the Plumbuita slum, Moldovan is ridden with bullets by a few dozens of Legionnaires."

"Zoologist and behavioral psychologist Dr. Jake Terrell and his team, which includes his wife, Maggie Anderson Terrell, are funded by the Franklin Foundation to conduct research with dolphins, namely to learn why they do the things they do. Their primary subject is a dolphin named Alpha - Pha for short - who was born at their research facility four years ago, and who the team raised after Pha's mother died. What Harold DeMilo, Jake's primary liaison at the Foundation, is unaware of, as is the rest of the world, but what Jake eventually divulges to DeMilo when he threatens to pull funding, is that Jake and Maggie's primary work is teaching Pha how to communicate in English. DeMilo vows to keep this information confidential as the Terrells are afraid of the outside world trying to exploit Pha. This work has stalled of late, with Pha refusing to speak, they believe because he has reached his sexual maturity. As such, they introduce a female dolphin named Beta, or Bea for short, to the research. It does more than the trick as Pha not only begins to communicate in English again, but also teaches Bea. Much to Jake's chagrin, DeMilo sends an ""old friend"" named Curtis Mahoney to the facility for a tour. What Jake and the team is unaware of is that Mahoney, who is not an old friend, blackmailed DeMilo to gain access. The team learns from DeMilo that Mahoney, out of that tour, is aware of the research and is threatening to go public. The Terrells figure they have to take preemptive action. However, what is happening with Mahoney is not all it appears on the surface, and involves a plot, indeed exploiting the dolphins, for a much more nefarious reason. When the Terrells learn what is happening, they not only try to foil the plot, but also have to make the difficult decision of what to do with Pha and Bea, which in turn may risk their research."

"The tension between a lonely policemen and the journeymen of the counter culture provides the subtext, and the stunning martian look of the Arizona mesa the backdrop, of a brilliant and influential debut feature by musician James William Guercio; the film is the missing link between The Searchers and No Country for Old Men. John Wintergreen is a diminutive motorcycle cop working the lonely highways of Arizona in the mid seventies. He works alone, but occasionally hooks up with his pal ""Zipper."" Wintergreen is conscientious and friendly, whereas Zipper is bored and argumentative, often holing up off the highway to read comic books rather than out on the road . Wintergreen is a Native American and has ambitions to be a detective. So when Zipper and Wintergreen find a delirious and disoriented elderly man wandering in the desert, the trail of how he got there leads back to a deserted shack. Inside is the body of a man who has committed suicide with a shotgun. Wintergreen airs his suspicions about the death, first to the coroner who is keen not to get involved, and then to Harve Poole, an Arizona detective. Harve believes John Wintergreen's suspicions are right and takes him under his wing as his driver and protege. This seems like the break Wintergreen needs to leave the big Harley police bike behind and to walk tall as a detective, in fresh duds, boots and a stetson, dispensing wisdom. But tensions between the two mount over cocktail waitress Jolene, and in differences of opinion over the murder, especially over some missing money, some hidden drugs and the suspected involvement of outlaw hippy bikers, whom Harve is keen to bust.

Some of his colleagues in the Highway Patrol, however, believe they are in a running battle with disrespectful, drug running, proto-terrorists. John is caught in the nexus of his loyalty to the police force, his ambitions to be detective, his companion'ss distrust of the hippies, Harve's domineering style, Zipper's recidivism, Jolene's manipulation, his sense of responsibility and his own easygoing natural empathy with the people he meets.

"Little Johnny Trotz travels all by himself from the US to Germany and gets to meet the pilot in the cockpit. Unfortunately, his grandma dies in a car accident on her way to the airport. Johnny finds a new home with the pilot and his sister. Ten years later, Johnny lives in a boarding school in Bamberg, Germany. He tells his story to new student Uli, who misses his home and parents. Appearing small and fearful, Uli is often being ridiculed by his classmates.
After being woken by school prefect Laban, the boys have lessons with two of their favourite teachers. Geography teacher ""Justus"" Böhk makes them interested in foreign countries, while German teacher Kreuzkamm submits them to a difficult spelling test. He trusts his son to take home the test sheets. However, his son is being abducted by boys from a rivaling school, who bind him to a cellar post and burn the sheets before his eyes.
Before taking measures, his classmates seek the advice of their friend ""Nichtraucher"" (non-smoker), a pianist who lives in an abandoned railway carriage. After learning that this rivalry has been going on for years, he suggests to name a boy from each side to fight it out. Matz from the boarding school wins the fight, but the other group refuses to set their prisoner free. The boarding school boys break into the cellar to get their classmate.
When they return to the school much later than allowed, Laban is waiting for them and takes them to Justus, the head of their house. Instead of punishing them, he listens to their story and then tells a story of his own: As a boy, he was being punished for sneaking out of school to visit his mother in hospital. But a boy from his class took on his sentence, so he could visit his mother again. Justus reveals that they have been friends way into adulthood, but that the friend, who had become a doctor, suddenly disappeared after his wife and child had died. When the name Robert Uthoff is mentioned, the boys realize that this is none other than Nichtraucher.
The class is rehearsing a play, written by Johnny. Under a pretext, they invite both men to the next rehearsal and are happy to see the old friends reunite.
Uli is fed up with being bullied and decides to do something impressive. He invites everyone to the school garden and then jumps out of the third floor window, believing an umbrella would act as a parachute. He breaks his leg, but school nurse Beate and Dr. Uthoff take care of him. Afterwards, Uthoff is offered a job in the hospital, and a romance is starting to develop between Beate and him.
Uli has to watch the school play in the gymnasium from his hospital bed. Johnny's play ""The flying classroom"" is inspired by Justus' lessons. In it, the class actually take a plane to visit places. This becomes a reality after Uli has learned that Martin's parents, who live in Mombasa, can't afford to spend time with their son in the summer break. Uli suggests to his father to invite the whole class, including Justus, to travel to Mombasa. Of course, the plane is being flown by Johnny's foster father."
"The next morning, Julia warns Peter that there is something going on
at the castle that she doesn't quite understand but that it could lead to
their destruction if they don't leave, but Peter doesn't want to go unless
Helga goes with him. When Helga calls him to her room and pleads with him
to help her because her body, soul, and mind are being destroyed, Peter
removes the garlic cross from around his neck and places it on Helga. When
Wanda sees the cross around Helga's neck, she grabs a poker, lifts the
necklace over Helga's head, tosses it in the fire, and smiles. Now there
is nothing standing in her way. She admits to Julia, who is beginning to
figure it out (having written a book about the Vargas), that Wanda and her
black sisters, are actually priestesses of Baroness Dania and that they
are planning for a mating between one of the sisters and a male descendent
of Dania's line, an event that can only happen once every nine years
during a particular phase of the moon -- the night of the Vampire. Wanda
also tells Julia that she and her brother are descendents of the traitor
Donnashova[sp?] who fingered Baroness Dania. Fortunately, one of her
priestesses scooped up her ashes, and they have been been keeping Dania
""alive"" for these past 300 years."
"Forty year old Norwegian-American divorcée Ann Stanley owns her own Manhattan based real estate agency specializing in upscale Manhattan apartments. She lives with her seventeen year old daughter Trina Stanley, and her mother, Maud Ericson, who acts more the teenager than Trina. Largely because of her uptight and regimented attitude, Ann has had no love in her life since divorcing her ex-husband, character actor Billy Boylan, an irresponsible man who she still loves as a friend and who she sees whenever he is in town between acting jobs and whenever he needs money from her. Ann's uptight attitude seems to have softened slightly ever since returning from a trip to Greece with Maud. What she has not told anyone is that her softened attitude is from a romantic one night only liaison with a young American man she met by happenstance by an out of the way Greek beach, he who tried to get her to be more carefree, if only for that one night. Purely by coincidence, she meets that man again in New York. He is twenty-two year old Peter Latham, a steel heir who is an acquaintance of Trina's. While Ann's family and friends encourage her to pursue a relationship with a wealthy southern gentleman client named J.D. Rogers, Peter pursues Ann behind the scenes, while Maud believes Peter wants to court Trina. Peter is falling in love with Ann. Although she admits she is flattered by Peter's declaration, Ann may not be able to get over the difference in their ages, regardless of what she may be feeling about him. If she can let go of that repressed attitude, she may give herself the opportunity to examine if she truly does have romantic feelings for Peter, and what to do about them if they do exist. Dealing with an issue with Trina, discussing Billy's own life with him, and meeting Peter's friends and family may give Ann some insight into the matter."

He insists, with as much charisma as ever, but now lumped together with the zeal of a recent convert, that he sees life clearly now as never before, because he is sober. He hectors his former drinking companions that they are meaninglessly clinging to ""pipe dreams"" of some kind of positive change in their lives, while continuing to drown their sorrows exactly as before.

The film is worth seeing for Jimi's performances, and to hear what his contemporaries have to say about him (Eric Clapton, Mitch Mitchell, Lou Reed, Mick Jagger, Pete Townsend, and others)."

"While on base in Norfolk, Virginia awaiting their next sea assignment, naval seamen Petty Officers Billy Buddusky and Richard Mulhall - nicknamed Badass and Mule respectively - are given a short term shore assignment by their Master at Arms: escort a prisoner to Portsmouth Naval Prison in New Hampshire by bus and train via Washington DC, New York City and Boston. That prisoner is eighteen year old seaman Larry Meadows, who has received a dishonorable discharge and an eight year prison sentence for the $40 theft of a charity box. The severity of the sentence is because the polio charity is the high profile pet project of the commanding officer's wife. They have to get Meadows to Portsmouth in five days, a trip they can accomplish in two. As such, Badass suggests to Mule that they milk the system by taking the five days, collecting on the per diems, and whooping it up on their way back to Norfolk with that per diem money in hand. The focus of their trip changes when they learn of the harshness of the sentence in relation to the crime, and after they meet Meadows, who they can see is an inexperienced, naive, somewhat simple and trustworthy boy whose young adulthood will be taken away from him. So, they decide to take the handcuffs off and give Meadows those adult experiences in the next five days that he has so far not had in his short adult life, as well as allow him to get some closure regarding issues in his personal life. They get into one misadventure after another en route. But as they get closer and closer to Portsmouth and the reality of the situation settles in, Badass, Mule and Meadows may look at the situation in a clearer light for themselves individually and for the other two."

She is approached by Pan-Oklahoma Oil who want to pay her for the oil rights to her property, they figure that they easily have the resources to drill a hundred wells, and even if one comes through, it will have made up their investment. Lena, however, vehemently declines their offer, wanting instead to drill on her own terms. Lena's decline of their offer leads to a stand-off of sorts between the two. Although Lena does not want his help, her father, Cleon Doyle (Sir John Mills), who was largely not there for her when she was growing up, hires an itinerant oil worker, Noble Mason (George C. Scott), to be her right-hand man. Lena accepts their help only on the condition that she remains the boss. Of what naive Cleon is unaware, when he hired Mason, is that Mason is the type of person whose allegiance goes to the highest bidder, and as such, he has no loyalty to Lena. But as the stand-off between her and Pan-Oklahoma, led by the vicious Captain Hellman (Jack Palance), increases, as Lena receives unofficial legal advice on the matter, and as Mason begins to get to know Lena, the two may begin to have a different type of relationship, one that doesn't have much of a chance against the wranglings of Pan-Oklahoma unless they strike oil quickly."

"James T. Hart is just entering his first year as a Harvard law student. Being a Midwesterner from Minnesota already makes him atypical from the Harvard stereotype. But typical of many of his fellow first year classmates, he is asked to join a study group, which ends up being six disparate individuals who may not be compatible beyond the fact that they are all aiming for success in their law studies which they equate with success in their future professional life. Although given a head's up by a colleague back in Minnesota, Hart is nonetheless ill-prepared for the reality that is the Contract Law class taught by the irascible and demanding Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. Beyond being academically bright, Hart also demonstrates that he has some level of street smarts in the deduction he makes in how to add a little extra insurance in how to obtain that elusive good grade in Kingsfield's class, if only there are enough hours in the day to obtain that continued level of insurance. Those hours are decreased when Hart embarks in a relationship with Susan Fields, a young woman he meets in town in an unusual circumstance. What ends up being their roller coaster of a relationship is largely directed by her unique perspective of what he is going through with law school in general, and Kingsfield's class in particular. As the year progresses, Hart comes to a changing perspective of Kingsfield, where Hart no longer just wants to get a good grade in the class, but also wants Kingsfield's admiration as he begins truly to admire Kingsfield."

In unfreezing Miles, the doctors have committed an illegal act in what is now a totalitarian police state, where records of the past have been destroyed and the resulting history unknown.

"Guy Debord's landmark cinematic analysis of consumer society is based on his influential sociological book ""La société du spectacle"" (1967). Debord was a leading member of the avant-garde art movement 'Situationist International'. This cinematic essay uses their method of 'détournement' to decontextualize and rearrange preexisting audiovisual materials and texts to critizise them and create new meaning. The result is a subversive collage of ideological (moving) images from socialist and capitalist societies that are presented here as artefacts of a global media 'spectacle': Social relations between people are mediated by artificial images and false representations that transform humans into mere passive consumers and 'spectators' of their alienated existence. Guy Debord's motivation was to create a radical social critique and a disruptive, anti-illusionist cinema as an antidote and revolutionary tool against the dominant cultural and sociopolitical forces of his time."

Eagle is certain that Veldini won't survive in the outside the way that Frank wants, and thus is able to convince another motley crew member, Duval Jax, based on his current abode and project, Veldini and the rest of the crew to work on an ultimate goal: to make the plane in which Duval is currently renting and living in operational so that they can escape the tyranny that is Veldini and their collective current lives by flying away to wherever their hearts' desire. In order to do so, they need to buy the plane and purchase the parts they can't scrounge from the scrap yard. That would require the collective to enter or reenter a life of larceny. The major obstacle to them achieving this goal is Frank, who would not hesitate to send Veldini back to prison for his own personal gain."

"Sort of a cross between Love Story (1970) and an earthy Rembrandt painting, this movie stars Rutger Hauer as gifted Dutch sculptor Eric, who has a stormy, erotic, and star-crossed romance with a beautiful young girl. The story follows the arc of their relationship and his interaction with her family. Told in flashback form, initially, Eric is seen as a libertine lothario collector, taking trophies from his sexual conquests and pasting them in a book. He sees a sculpture he made of his lost lover and goes into a flashback of his relationship with his wife. He meets the girl, falls in love with and marries her, and we meet her parents: a charming, well meaning, bumbling father, and his shrew of a wife, who's convinced Eric is too much of a bohemian to make a good mate for her daughter. Eventually, the petty jealousies, the sexual hijinks, and the climactic vomit scene prove to be too much for the marriage, and Eric and his lady separate. Flash forward several months, and Eric finds the girl back in The Netherlands after an American sojourn. Their reunion is short lived. The somewhat melodramatic ending mirrors Love Story (1970)."

"In this comedy, set during the Nazi occupation of France, Peter Sellers plays most major male parts, so he stars in nearly every scene, always bumbling in inspector Clouseau-style.

Rather awkwardly, these events coincide with his completing a self-portrait, which he keeps under lock and key to prevent the magic from turning on him. Returning to London, Moore paints portraits of the three men who cheated him, and mutilates the paintings to exact his revenge. He is also obliged to put his own portrait out in the open, because leaving it in an airless strongbox nearly suffocated him. A workman subsequently drops a can of paint thinner on the picture through a skylight, and Moore, as a result of the voodoo, suffers a correspondingly messy death."

"Visions of Eight is a film about the personal dreams which make the Olympic Games transcend the physical into the spiritual. when granted the authority to record the 1972 official film of the Games, the Wolper Organization elected to eschew the traditional documentary approach in favour of the human stories spelled out during the contests.

Connors, not for the murder of which they have no idea of the McKluskys' suspicions against Connors, but concerning an active but somewhat cold IRS file, namely yet unproven but well known unreported lucrative profits in bilking moonshiners. They also know that the sheriff is crooked in other ways, but the IRS only has the jurisdiction on the tax evasion issue. They provide Gator with a souped up car fit for moonshine runs that would be able to outrun almost any on road vehicle, and a contact in Bogan County, Dude Watson, a mechanic who has no option but to cooperate, despite his own fears about Connors, in he being a con on probation, the conditions which they know he has broken. Dude in turn is able to set Gator up with moonshiner Roy Boone to infiltrate the business in the county as one of his runners.

The correspondence includes a photograph of Rowan. Upon his arrival on Summerisle, Howie finds that the locals are a seemingly simple minded lot who provide little information beyond the fact that they know of no Rowan Morrison and do not know the girl in the photo. Mrs. Morrison admits to having a daughter, seven year old Myrtle, but no Rowan. As Howie speaks to more and more people, he begins to believe that Rowan does or did live on the island, but that the locals are hiding their knowledge of her.

"2293. Zardoz, an unseen ""God"" who speaks through an idol, a large stone statue of a head, leads a barbaric race called the Brutals, who live a harsh existence in the Outlands. Zardoz tells the Brutals that once they die, they will be transported to the Vortex, where they will live happily as immortals. He has armed a small group, the Exterminators, with guns, as Zardoz's philosophy is that killing is good, and procreation is the root of all that is bad. In reality, Zardoz is Arthur Frayn, from a competing, more advanced race, called ""the Eternals"", who live in paradise in the Vortex. The Eternals truly are immortal as they do not age and their bodies undergo reconstruction if they ""die"". As such, they truly do not believe in procreation as their society has reached perfect equilibrium. Past human acts such as sex and sleep are obsolete in their advanced state. All major decisions are achieved through pure democracy. The Eternals, however, are not immune to non life threatening disease or sin, the latter which is punishable by aging, only making their life less pleasant, but not ever killing them. Arthur's mission as Zardoz is to control, monitor, and study the Brutals for the Eternals. Being in the Outlands, Arthur is isolated without communication back to the Vortex and the Eternals. In his work as an Exterminator, Zed, by accident, is able to find his way to the Vortex as a still alive being.

Amongst the Eternals who have direct interactions with Zed are: May, the lead scientist, who believes Zed is a blessing in that they have not had access to a Brutal in some time; Friend, a hedonist who wants to use Zed as the animal he considers him to be; and Consuela, the hard lined one who believes in vigilante justice. In the Eternals' access to Zed, they may learn if he making it to the Vortex was indeed an accident. In addition, their so-called Utopian society may be exposed for what it truly is."
"Fritz Haarmann, aka the Butcher of Hanover and the Vampire of Hanover, was a German serial killer responsible for the murders of two dozen boys and young men during the so-called 'years of crisis' between the wars. His case would partly inspire Fritz Lang's M, and its central character portrayed by Peter Lorre, as well as this forgotten gem from 1973. Tenderness of the Wolves treats the viewer to a few weeks in the company of a killer. Baby-faced and shaven-headed, in a manner that recalls both M and F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu, Haarmann is a fascinating, repulsive figure. Using his status as a police informant to procure his victims, he dismembers their bodies after death and sells the flesh to restaurants, dumping the remainder out of sight. This isn't an easy film to watch, but it certainly gets under the skin - Produced by"
"The historical figure played by Yves Montand in State of Siege was Dan Mitrioni, a former Indiana police chief working in Montevideo within USAID's Office of Public Safety, which in fact was training civilian police in kidnapping, torture and assassinations of suspected Communists parallel to School of the Americas training of South American military personnel. The film opens with the American found dead in the back of a car. We subsequently learn how and why this came about. The Tupamoros, a popular Uruguay insurgency that robbed the rich and gave to the poor, had captured and interrogated the American ""trainer"" at length about his actions and motivations. The captive-captors interactions that take the form of a trial are the heart of the film, revealing the motives and objectives of the insurgents and the defensive rationalizations underlying violent American interference in Latin American governments. The American never breaks and confesses, so they are left with no alternative but to execute him for his many capital crimes."

Uncle Frank hires profession killer Harry Crown (Richard Harris) and pays him 100 G's to rub out Big Eddie, and the latter sends for Marvin ""Claw"" Zuckerman (Chuck Connors), a sadistic and demented killer, who is one hand short of having two hands. And Marvin hates Harry because it was Harry who cut off his hand when Marvin savagely mistreated a girl. In between all the blood and bullets, there is time for romance.

"""We're in this together, you know."" Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974) by Robert Getchell is a Romantic Drama about a recently widowed and bullied housewife Alice Hyatt (Ellen Burstyn), who leaves New Mexico in a station wagon with her spoiled and mouthy, twelve-year-old son, Tommy (Alfred Lutter III), to start life anew in Monterey, California, her childhood home. Alice wants to earn money as a singer, and thinks that Monterey is where she and Tommy will find happiness, but, after a short-lived gig and a psychotic boyfriend, which she first experiences on the road, she escapes, only to get as far as Tucson. It's here that she finds work as a waitress in Mel and Ruby's chaotic little diner along with new friends and a rugged and handsome cowboy, David, who all convince her to stay in Tucson. And Tommy doesn't mind either. Throughout this film, Alice struggles to be a single mom to the consistently ill-mannered and disrespectful Tommy, while also trying to find a loving man that she can stand up to. As it turns out, David lashes out at the much-deserving brat, Tommy, and challenges Alice to be a better mom and a stronger woman. Though the dramatic showdown between Alice and David in the diner is meant to convince us that Alice has finally grown a spine, it was more of a show of Alice ""trying"" to be tough, but not actually feeling it, especially because up until this point, she is mostly ineffectual. Everything she and Tommy says and does seems to be more of a repeat of their same bad behavior, rather than any progressive improvements. Another road stop for Alice and Tommy, in between Phoenix and Tucson, would have been a good opportunity to show Alice having a little bit of success with a man and Tommy, to show that she is learning from her mistakes."

"and Fascism. The stories loosely center on mid-teen Titta and his household, including his adolescent brother, his ever-supportive mother who is always defending him against his father, his freeloading maternal Uncle Lallo, and his paternal grandfather who slyly has eyes and hands for the household maid. Other townsfolk include: town beauty Gradisca, who can probably have any man she wants but generally has none as most think she out of their league; Volpina, the prostitute; Giudizio, the historian; a blind accordionist; and an extremely buxom tobacconist. The several vignettes presented include: the town bonfire in celebration of spring; life at Titta's school with his classmates and teachers; Titta's father Aurelio at his beachfront construction worksite and his and his workmates' encounter with Volpina; Titta's confessions to the priest about his burgeoning sexuality; Aurelio being questioned by authorities about his anti-Fascist leanings; a fantasy sequence at the luxurious Grand Hotel; a family outing with Aurelio's institutionalized brother Teo; many townsfolk embarking on a sail to witness a marine event passing by their town; an annual car race; Titta's fantasy encounter with the tobacconist after closing hours coming true; events surrounding the big snowfall that year, including a family tragedy; and an event centering on Gradisca and her future."
"The taxi then takes them to a restaurant called Osteria Italiana. It is where Hitler used to eat and Emmi had always wanted to eat there. The entire restaurant is empty except for the two of them and the waiter who is staring at them from the doorway. Emmi suggests they order the most expensive things on the menu, since it is such a special day. Ali says he will eat whatever she eats. She calls the waiter over and orders their food. The waiter asks her how she would like the Chateaubriand prepared. She is confused about the question, so the waiter asks if she wants it rare or medium. She tells him rare sounds good. Then she changes her mind once the waiter explains that rare means almost raw. The waiter then asks if they would like an aperitif to start with. Emmi is not sure which one to ask for, so the waiter recommends the house aperitif. After the waiter walks away Emmi says how he really had her on the rack there and it can be difficult if you are not used to things like that. The couple stares at each other and then they both stare forward. The scene ends with them looking ahead through the doorway."
"A humorous documentary looking at the animal life over the course of a year that gather around an oasis situated in a desert in Eastern Africa. Highlights of this being the period when the fruit from the trees surrounding the water hole. Fall into the water and ferment. The animals that drink there end up being rather intoxicated, including the hangover the following morning. All together a good, if now a bit dated, piece of documentary making.
The documentary covers all aspects of life around the water hole as the waters change from being in almost flood like conditions. To the water drying up into a large muddy puddle during the dry season. The animals that are featured being as diverse as warthogs, elephants, tortoises and monkeys.
The cinematography is excellent considering the conditions endured and the length of time spent in the field shooting the footage. The resultant film is refreshingly devoid of computer and other special effects, instead relying on the editing and narration to convey events to the audience."
"Surya, the son of a wealthy landowner, returns home from the city after graduating from school and is expected by his father to get married and take over a piece of land. He settles in not without conflict with the other people from the village, whose traditions he does not share. He uses his position to begin a love affair with Laxmi, who is unhappily married to a deaf-mute drunk. When Laxmi is left by her husband, Surya invites her to live at his house, much to the disdain of everybody else, who see this as a breach of the caste system. Their love affair ends abruptly when Surya's wife arrives. Rather than keeping to his promises, Surya drives Laxmi out of the house; when it turns out that she is pregnant, she suddenly becomes a threat that must be disposed of. The final scene of this movie raised many eyebrows upon its release in 1973, as it was seen as a disquieting symbol of rebellion against the country's social structures. Shabana Azmi's compelling performance as Laxmi laid the foundation for her becoming one of the great actresses of the independent Indian cinema of the 1970s and 80s."

Taxi driver Max Kravitz, who pimps on the side, lives with his two grown sons - early twenty-something medical student Lennie Kravitz, and late teen Duddy Kravitz, who has just graduated from high school - in the working class Jewish neighborhood of Montréal. Lennie receives all the positive attention from family and others of authority in the neighborhood, especially from Max's businessman brother, their Uncle Benjy, who is financing Lennie's medical school education, while Duddy is on the most part neglected. The only elder in the family and in the neighborhood who shows Duddy any respect is their zaida. As such, Duddy aspires to his zaida's assertion that land ownership is the way to make a name for oneself, especially after Duddy finds a lake, the entire property around which he would like to purchase. With only his ingenuity and chutzpah at hand, both of which he has plenty, Duddy embarks on one get rich scheme after another to make money to buy the land, usually following the belief that doing favors for those in power will yield financial favors in return. By Duddy's side through many of these schemes is his French-Canadian Catholic girlfriend Yvette, who loves Duddy but hates how he reduces his affections for her to economic terms. Yvette stays with Duddy despite the probability that there is no long term future for them due to their religious differences. The primary questions become whether Duddy's high risk ventures will ultimately result in his end goal of being able to buy all the land, whether this goal is worth it at any cost, whether he will garner respect from his family and the community, and whether he will find true happiness and ultimate fulfillment in achieving these."

"February, 1962 in rural Louisiana. While the civil rights movement has begun in much of the country, it has not yet largely reached the rural Deep South, where the black populace does not want to rock the boat in taking what little the white majority has given them without incident. In this time and setting, two concurrent events occur. First, Jimmy, a young black man with local ties, wants to do something meaningful but non-violent as a civil rights action in the segregation that still exists: to have a young black woman drink out of a water fountain labeled as white only that is outside the courthouse in the town of Bayonne, he knowing that if he or any male did so that they would only get beaten, while they want the girl to be arrested to that they can subsequently protest with cause. And second, Quentin Lerner, a white magazine journalist from New York City, has come wanting to interview black Jane Pittman on what is her 110th birthday for a human interest piece, Miss Jane who agrees after an initial hesitation. Remembering her life with clarity, she is able to start her story, told in flashback, from when she was a slave in the pre-Civil War era, what Quentin was hoping she could do. As Miss Jane tells the one hundred or so years of her life and what she has seen in that century as a black woman in the Deep South, Quentin comes to realize that the information that he has on hand from these interviews is more than a human interest piece. In she telling her story and seeing what is happening around her with Jimmy and with her own son Ned among other loved ones before Jimmy, Miss Jane may come to her own reckoning as to what she has to do at this, the near end of her life."

"The Mafia's Don learns that the City is planning a new civic center, and is buying the land where it will be, to make easy money when the city council will buy it. The one piece the Don doesn't have yet, is the old African-American karate school owned by Papa Byrd.

"On the evening that the Pi Kappa Sigma sorority (which is headed by their house mother, the booze swilling Mrs. Mac) is holding their Christmas party, the house receives the latest in a string of obscene phone calls from who the girls call ""the moaner"", but who identifies himself as ""Billy"". Some like Jess Bradford don't like the calls, others like brash Barb Coard are somewhat amused by the calls, others like Phyl Carlson don't think much of them, and straight laced Clare Harrison is offended by them. The calls are just the latest trouble for Jess, who is pregnant and who doesn't want to tell her sensitive but volatile boyfriend, music student Peter Smythe. For this latest call, which is a bit more elaborate than those previous, Barb decides to make a snide comment in return, which provokes a threat by Billy. The next morning, one of the girls goes missing. The desk sergeant at the police station doesn't think much about this as a missing person case, especially as the police are already dealing with another missing person case (a thirteen year old girl named Janice Quaife). The police don't act until more information is brought to the attention of Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller by Clare's boyfriend, Chris Hayden. As Lt. Fuller and his men investigate, which includes placing a wire tap on the sorority house phones, more and more incidents happen to those living at the sorority house. In addition, the obscene calls continue and increasingly have a personal connotation to one of the girls, which includes information that could only be known by those involved. Or is there another reason why the caller knows so much about the specific girl in question?"

"In the American Old West of 1874, construction on a new railroad led by Lyle (Burton Gilliam) runs into quicksand. The route has to be changed, which will require it to go through Rock Ridge, a frontier town where everyone has the last name of ""Johnson"" (including a ""Howard Johnson"", a ""Dr. Samuel Johnson"", a ""Van Johnson"" and an ""Olson N. Johnson""). The conniving State Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) wants to buy the land along the new railroad route cheaply by driving out the townspeople. He sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky assistant Taggart (Slim Pickens), to scare them away, prompting the townsfolk to demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (Mel Brooks) appoint a new sheriff. The Attorney General persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to select Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged. (Bart had hit Taggart in the head with a shovel after Taggart ignored him and his black friend sinking in quicksand, deciding to save their handcar instead.) Lamarr believes a black lawman will so offend the townspeople that they will either abandon Rock Ridge or lynch the new sheriff, with either result paving the way for him to take over the town."

"Shot immediately after production on Flesh for Frankenstein has finished, and using the same main actors, Morrissey's Andy Warhol-sponsored take on Dracula is no less weird, although in many ways it may be the better film, though it's less over the top. Instead of the weird Doctor Frankenstein, we get Dracula as a sort of aging silent film star a la Valentino, dyeing his hair black and moping around in outrageous costumes, and that's before we get to the most literal take I've seen on the ""vampires as aristocrats sucking the working classes dry"" metaphor seen, with Joe Dallesandro playing a literal Marxist farmhand who is the only one to realize the threat of Dracula, in between sleeping with his employers' daughters. It's weird, campy, and not exactly good, but it's fascinating to watch, and Udo Kier's all-in performance as a sickly vampire confined to a wheelchair for lack of virgin blood is kind of mesmerizing. Count Dracula is dying, since there are no virgins left for him to feed on, and he leaves his sister, who is even worse off (and is never mentioned again) in the castle's crypt before leaving Romania for Italy, where his manservant has convinced him there are more virgins available, since ""it's a very Catholic country"". At their arrival, they're quickly put in touch with the Di Fiore family, whose patriarch, the Marchese Di Fiore, has gambled away most of the family fortune, but whose four daughters are all supposed to be virgins and available for marriage. However, it turns out the two daughters that are of appropriate age are having lots and lots of sex with the estate's farmhand, who is also an avowed Socialist who rails against the family and the upper classes in general, and while the family is either oblivious or gradually being seduced by Dracula, he might be the only one who can stop the threat."

"It's the early 1930s. Working their way up the ladder largely on chutzpah, Roch Sifreddi and François Capella, who became best friends in their unlikely partnership, have risen to the top of the organized crime world in Marseilles. Shortly after reaching the top, Capella is murdered. Sifreddi eventually learns that the murder was orchestrated by international businessman Giovanni Volpone, new to Marseilles from Italy, whose ultimate goal is to take control of the city in all aspects--legal and illegal. While Sifreddi sees Volpone's action as the start of a gangland war, Volpone has other thoughts in sending a longer-lasting message to Sifreddi and others who may want to fill his shoes. Volpone has specific reasons for wanting Marseilles--a war he will want to wage in most of the western world to reach his end goal. Standing by Sifreddi in this war is Lola, a former prostitute friend to both Sifreddi and Capella, who was Capella's girlfriend at the time of his death, and Sifreddi and Capella's loyal and long-serving head henchman, Fernand. In this battle, Sifreddi can no longer rely on the hands-off approach by the police, former Commissioner Fanti, who would only intervene if the tit-for-tat killings got out of hand. Fanti has now been replaced by Commissioner Cazenave, who is a little out of his element in dealing with such matters. Under the circumstances, the police may have their own ideas of what they would like to happen with Sifreddi and Volpone's war, especially as Volpone views the law as only applying to poor people."

They can't even pronounce his name, they who call him Conrack. The teachers before him, including the school principal Mrs. Scott, have always treated the students as being slow and basically unteachable of academics. Conrack, a free thinking man, decides to expose his students not only to the academic subjects, but also to the gamut of life skills from brushing one's teeth to human anatomy, and some of the fun things in life like classical music, art, baseball, movies, swimming (despite living on an island, the islanders live in fear of the river because they don't know how to swim), and Halloween.

"Separated into four independent short stories, this erotic anthology comprised of tantalising tales about sexual desire and its diverse manifestations, intertwines the omnipotent human urge with the fervour of desire, curiosity and self-exploring, the forbidden with the obscene. Unapologetically, it attempts an insight, other times superficially and other times with a more comical approach, into subjects such as teenage virginal naiveté and the farewell to childhood in the first segment titled ""La Marée (The Tide)"", while in the following part named ironically ""Thérèse Philosophe"", a curious teenage bourgeois girl surrenders to the delights of erotic self-stimulation and philosophy. Next, in the blood-drenched vignette named ""Erzsébet Báthory"", the vanity of youth and the chase for immortality is explored through the legend of the murderous Countess Elizabeth Báthory and her vampiric tendencies involving the bright-red and warm virginal blood. Ultimately, in the final segment titled ""Lucrezia Borgia"", the outrageous and scandalous act of incest is vividly depicted including the infamous Lucrezia Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI, and her lustful Cardinal sibling Cesare Borgia."

When Annie P. Miller, known as ""Daisy,"" saunters onto the patio carrying a parasol, Randolph identifies her as his older sister. Frederick engages Daisy in conversation and learns that she and Randolph are from upstate New York, and plan to visit Italy after their stay in Switzerland. Daisy chats nonstop, hardly allowing Frederick time to respond to her questions. They make plans to visit Chillon, a nearby castle. Later, Frederick's aunt, Mrs. Costello, tells him that the Miller family are not well-mannered. She criticizes Daisy and her mother's familiarity with their European courier, Eugenio, and suspects they may even dine with him. Frederick tells her about the plans he made to go to Chillon with Daisy, and she reprimands him. After dinner at the hotel, Frederick finds Daisy on the patio. Based on Frederick's description of his aunt, Daisy suspects she disapproves of her but tells him not to worry. When Daisy introduces her mother to Frederick and mentions their upcoming date, Mrs. Miller drones on, in the same manner as her daughter, about her reasons for not visiting the castle. As in conversation with Daisy, Frederick finds it difficult to interrupt. Daisy begs Frederick to take her out on a boat, but Mrs. Miller does not approve. Eugenio arrives and, at Mrs. Miller's command, forbids Daisy to go on the boat. Daisy leaves with her mother and Eugenio, telling Frederick she hopes the disappointment doesn't keep him awake. One morning, Frederick and Daisy run to catch the ferryboat heading to Chillon. At the castle, Frederick tells her he went to school in Geneva as a boy and has lived in Europe ever since. After he recites a poem, Daisy decides he would be a good teacher for Randolph and suggests he accompany her family to Italy, but he declines, saying he must return to Geneva. Agitated by the rejection, Daisy storms outside where Frederick catches up to her. She demands to know if he has a romantic interest in Geneva but Frederick denies it. Calming down, she asks him to meet her when her family is in Rome, and he agrees. Sometime later, Frederick visits his aunt at her new apartment in Rome. She supplies him with gossip about Daisy, namely that she has been associating with an Italian gentleman. Frederick attends a tea party at the home of Mrs. Walker, and encounters Daisy there. The hostess is irritated as Daisy flirts with Frederick and urges him to escort her to her next destination. Soon after, Mrs. Walker spies from a nearby carriage as Frederick and Daisy meet her Italian friend, Mr. Giovanelli, in a park. The trio walk, arm in arm, with Daisy in the middle. Mrs. Walker sends a messenger to Frederick who goes to her carriage, where she informs him that Daisy is embarrassing herself and should come to the carriage at once. Daisy comes over with Giovanelli and introduces him, but Mrs. Walker orders her into the carriage, saying her reputation is in danger as long as she stays out with the two men. Daisy refuses and asks Frederick what he thinks, and he agrees with Mrs. Walker. Peeved, Daisy leaves with Giovanelli. Mrs. Walker insists Frederick get into the carriage. As they drive away, she tells him everyone in town is talking about Daisy and her reckless behavior. Frederick agrees that Daisy's family seems tasteless, but insists that he likes her regardless. Disappointed, Mrs. Walker allows Frederick to leave the carriage and rejoin Daisy and Giovanelli. Before he catches up to them, however, Giovanelli spots him and uses Daisy's parasol to block Frederick's view. One night, Mrs. Miller arrives at Mrs. Walker's home for a party, apologizes that her daughter is late, and explains that she has been singing and playing piano with Giovanelli at their hotel. Later, Daisy and her Italian suitor arrive, and she insists that he sing for Mrs. Walker's guests. While Giovanelli performs, Frederick finds Daisy and warns her that her actions are improper, saying that flirting is an American custom, unacceptable in European society. Daisy rejects his advice and reunites with Giovanelli after his performance. When Daisy departs with her mother and Giovanelli, Mrs. Walker ignores their goodbyes, telling Frederick that Daisy will never be invited to her home again. Frederick later visits Daisy at her hotel and notices two bellboys snickering at him, assuming he's another of her many suitors. Frederick runs into his aunt, and they observe Daisy walking with Giovanelli. His aunt again discourages Frederick from associating with her. One day, at the Millers' hotel suite, Frederick visits with Daisy and Giovanelli, who are at the piano, playing ""Pop Goes the Weasel."" Giovanni plays a song for Daisy to sing, and Frederick watches, mesmerized. Mrs. Miller returns home and mentions her suspicion that Daisy might be engaged to Giovanelli, and Frederick abruptly leaves. One day, Daisy finds Frederick walking alone and joins him. He informs her that Mrs. Miller mentioned a possible engagement, and Daisy teases him by saying she is engaged and, moments later, denying it. In a carriage at night, Frederick confides to his friend, Charles, that he cannot decide whether Daisy is reckless or exceedingly naive. Despondent, he leaves the carriage and walks home. On his way, he passes through the Colosseum and runs into Daisy and Giovanelli. He reprimands Giovanelli for bringing her there, as it is a breeding ground for the Roman flu. Frederick criticizes Daisy's lack of prudence, and she leaves in a huff. At the opera, Frederick overhears a group of women gossiping about Daisy and learns that she has caught the Roman flu. Soon after, Frederick visits the Millers' hotel suite. Mrs. Miller complains that Giovanelli has disappeared since Daisy became ill and says that Daisy wanted Frederick to know she is definitely not engaged. Sometime later, Frederick mourns alongside Giovanelli, Mrs. Miller, and Randolph at Daisy's funeral. Giovanelli tells Frederick that Daisy was the most innocent girl he knew but admits she never would have married him. Frederick later expresses to his aunt that he regrets the manner in which he treated Daisy."

"News which has yet to hit the media, but which has hit informal local gossip channels, is that a patient at Greenwood, an institution for the criminally insane, has escaped. That gossip does not largely include the fact of several murders that have occurred since, the perpetrator most certainly the escapee. Concurrently, a young woman named Belle Adams (Hayley Mills), travelling on her own, is trying to make her way from the Greenwood area to the south coast, specifically to Wickham where she has a compulsion to visit, and where she has not been since she lived there when she was a child. Following the deaths of her parents in a car accident, she became a ward of her uncle, that being the reason for moving from Wickham.

Who Belle ends up spending most of the time with on her trek is a young Birmingham-based travelling salesman named Stephen Slade (Simon Ward), who demonstrates that he has a bit of a temper and imbibes just a little too much, perhaps to calm his nerves which can spark his temper. Belle and Stephen's interactions with each other are colored by relationships from their past, Belle's with her uncle, and Stephen's with an ex-girlfriend. Their time together is also overshadowed by a potentially violent encounter they have with a couple of bikers. Still with no news of the escapee in the papers, Belle catches Stephen is what looks to be a couple of lies. Could these lies be hiding that he is the escapee and thus a murderer?"

Dennis finally convinces Kelly the D9 must be destroyed. He suggests dynamite. Near camp, Chub and Dutch are refueling the Grader. Dutch tells Chub that they are both likely to join the other two buried near the beach. Kelly and Dennis pull up in the jeep and the four men witness the rogue D9 destroy their camp, tents and all. The four men head up to higher ground and watch the D9 systematically destroy everything in camp. The D9 sits out in the brush as the men survey the damage to camp. Dennis reports that there is enough canned food and water for a couple days - enough until the supply ship arrives in a few days. Dutch finally has his answer, ""Remote control. That's got to be it. That thing is running by remote control."" Dutch suggests to Kelly and Dennis that someone else must be on the island operating the D9. Kelly decides the four should head for higher ground. They take the two jeeps and the pickup truck. The D9 starts up and follows the men. The pickup truck can't make it up the grade. The men split up. Kelly and Chub explore the higher ground. From the top of the hill Kelly spots the D9 coming up a ravine. Kelly and Chub pile some kindling and douse it with gasoline. Their plan is to build a signal fire in hope of attracting a boat or airplane. They drive away after lighting the fire. Chub has an idea. He suggests ramming the pickup into the bulldozer. All the fuel barrels on the truck will catch fire and that should destroy any rubber parts and melt the electrical wiring. The D9 destroys the signal fire. The D9 ambushes the men. It destroys the pickup truck. Dutch was able to jump free, but Chub was unable to exit the truck before the D9 destroys it. And then there were three graves next to the beach. Dutch is convinced the D9 knew the plan. He tells Kelly, ""It knew. That ambush. It knew what we were gonna do and it did it first."" Both Dennis and Kelly think Dutch is losing it. The D9's next move is to plow a pile of rocks down on the men on the beach. One rock strikes Dennis. At the second rock fall the three men drive off in the orange jeep. The men wait in a ravine while the D9 lurks in the bushes. They can hear it, but they can't see the hellish thing. They decide to leave."

"1944 in Nazi occupied France. Living in the largely rural southwest of the country, Lucien Lacombe is a restless young man who is easily distracted. He comes from a peasant farming family, his father who is currently a POW, while his mother, with the help of laborers, operates the farm. On his latest visit home, Lucien, who has no political or nationalistic inclinations, makes attempts to join the Resistance as he does not want to return to his nursing home job in the small nearby town. He is turned down largely because of his age. As such, he is easily co-opted to join the Gestapo instead when the opportunity arises by chance, even after he sees the brutality often exacted by his new colleagues, that brutality by which he is largely unaffected emotionally, even if it is against people he knows. He seems to be motivated by money to help his mother, and the other favors he can provide through the Nazis' position of power. His association with the Nazis is despite warnings from some that the end of the war is near, the Americans who will ultimately liberate France from the Germans. Lucien's life, and that of the others involved, becomes more complicated when he falls for France Horn, the daughter of local tailor, Albert Horn. The issue is that the Horns are Jewish. Lucien may have to make a decision between his allegiance to the Nazis versus his feelings for France. Conversely, the Horns have to decide how to deal with Lucien, whose association with the Nazis they naturally abhor, and who they may not be able to refuse or deny as he is the one wielding the gun, regardless of what they feel for him as an individual. France's actions may also be driven by her feelings of being Jewish, a peoples who seemingly are repressed on all sides."

"During the appeal trial, his lawyer forces the arresting policeman to admit that one of the words that Lenny is being charged for saying in public is often used at the police station, which also is a public place. Then his lawyer suggests that Lenny's work is found in the social satire of Aristophanes and Jonathan Swift. A professor of religion testifies that Lenny's routines convey a sincere message that exposes hypocrisy. A recording of a performance is played, one in which Lenny riffs on the phrase, ""to come,"" and arranges his words into a kind of beat poem. Although the judge is offended, the jury votes for acquittal. Lenny, however, is dissatisfied, feeling that he won because of the jury's idiosyncrasies rather than the acknowledgment of First Amendment rights."

For one thing, he's run across several people whom he's never met. For another, they all seem to be of a different time and place."
"Both trifles and structure are tossed out the door by director Ken Russell in this film. Here, historical content matters less than metaphors, feelings, emotions, and interpretations. Pay close attention, as every word and frame is intended to be important. The film takes place on a single train ride, in which the sickly composer Gustav Mahler (Robert Powell) and his wife Alma (Georgina Hale) confront the reasons behind their faltering marriage and dying love. Each word evokes memories of the past, so the audience witnesses events of Mahler's life that somewhat explain his present state.

At the time the victim is found, the train is unexpectedly stopped and delayed due to snow in remote Yugoslavia, which may be problematic for the murderer in getting away now that Poirot is on the case, which he is doing as a favor to Bianchi as not to get the Yugoslav police involved. Poirot quickly learns that the victim was not who he presented himself to be and has a connection to a five-year-old American kidnapping and murder case of infant Daisy Armstrong, murdered in spite of the fact that her parents had paid the requested ransom. The murderer in that case has long been convicted and executed but the ransom moneys were never recovered, a known accomplice never captured, and both the Armstrong parents have since tragically died.

There is also a great deal of evidence discovered on the train, which pulls his thoughts in many directions. These pieces of information may complicate the deduction of who is the murderer."

Remorseful, she cries and argues with Bushrod, who says the only reason he puts up with her bossiness is because he knows how hard it must have been for her to survive on her own. Thomasine becomes irate when Bushrod accuses her of acting like a man, but they soon kiss and make up. Back at the photography studio, Bogardie studies the photograph of Thomasine and Bushrod, and the photographer guesses that Thomasine wanted to be on the left side so that her name would appear first on the wanted poster. Thomasine and Bushrod gain notoriety as they rob several more banks, often wearing fancy new clothes. They make frequent visits to a small village, delivering money and supplies to poor Mexican and African American farmers. One morning, Thomasine reads to Bushrod from a newspaper article that identifies them as folk heroes. They laugh at the article's inaccuracies, but later argue as they camp in a forest and Thomasine struggles to cook a rabbit. She reprimands Bushrod for giving away all their money, reiterating her desire to own a home. Going into the village alone, Thomasine is caught by bounty hunters. Bushrod gets word that she is being held at the church, and helps her escape by disguising himself as a nun. Bogardie catches up to the fugitives on the road, but misses them when he fires several shots, allowing the couple to escape once again. Traveling at night, Bushrod and Thomasine happen upon Pecolia, a blind Native American woman. Pecolia and her companion, Seldon, inform Bushrod that his mother was a Comanche, and Pecolia cryptically warns Bushrod that he does not have much time. The next day, a general store clerk realizes Thomasine and Bushrod are bank robbers and strikes Bushrod. However, as the clerk draws his rifle, a Jamaican man named Jomo appears and shoots him. Bushrod embraces Jomo, an old friend, and leads him back to the abandoned house where he and Thomasine are hiding out. Bogardie questions the clerk Jomo shot, learning that Jomo has joined the couple. Jomo drives Thomasine and Bushrod's stolen car into town, angering Bushrod, who fears that someone might follow him. Thomasine cries and confesses that she is pregnant, but Bushrod celebrates the news, promising that the next job will be their last one, and they will settle down on a ranch in Mexico. Jomo returns from town in a new car, and Thomasine and Bushrod admonish him for being conspicuous. However, Jomo assures the two that he was not followed. That night, Thomasine admits to Bushrod that she was a bounty hunter while they were apart, and she lied about having a boyfriend when they reunited, prompting Bushrod to kiss her. When Jomo returns to town the next day, Bogardie finds him, and demands to know Thomasine and Bushrod's whereabouts. Jomo refuses to answer, so Bogardie drops him into a pit of rattlesnakes. Worried about Jomo, Thomasine and Bushrod ride into town. As Bushrod stops the car, Bogardie appears and shoots Thomasine dead. Enraged, Bushrod runs after the marshal, but is shot at by a firing squad. After Bogardie shoots Bushrod in the chest, the victim returns fire, sending a bullet into Bogardie's forehead."

When he is found by one of the many who know who he really is, Thunderbolt is able to escape when he literally runs into a twenty-something man nicknamed Lightfoot (Jeff Bridges) (in reality, when Lightfoot runs into him). Despite not knowing anything about the other, the two decide to hang out together since they seem to have a similar temperament as two good old boys who have a penchant for doing things to bring them on the wrong side of the law. As they travel the American west together, there are people on their tail trying to kill them. When Lightfoot brings up the topic of robbing a bank, Thunderbolt's true history comes to light: he's a bank robber whose last job netted five hundred thousand dollars still hidden where only he of the surviving team members knows. The media reported that the money had been recovered, which, in reality, was a sting operation by the Police to draw out the robbers. It, however, led to Thunderbolt's accomplices believing he double-crossed them, hence the reason they now want him dead. Thunderbolt and Lightfoot learn that recovering the money may be a difficult task at the same time that two of Thunderbolt's old team members, Eddie Goody (Geoffrey Lewis) and Red Leary (George Kennedy), who are out to kill him, also learn the truth that the money was never recovered, and that Thunderbolt did not double cross them. In light of these new circumstances, Lightfoot believes he has an ingenious plan which requires the assistance of the old team, which, if successful, would make them all rich. Will the magic happen this second time around with Lightfoot added to the mix? And will old and new allegiances hold fast through to the completion of the scheme?"

As the dedication party proceeds on schedule, Roberts finds the building's wiring is in worse shape than he could have expected, and it all blows up when the burning storage closet suddenly erupts into the corridors. The fire spreads with such speed that the entire San Francisco fire department must be called in, led by Battalion Chief Michael O'Halloran, who expresses to Roberts his distaste for skyscrapers because the department can't easily combat a fire above the seventh floor.

In taking over the affairs of the Lyndon mansion, Barry is able to live a means of his liking, all off the Lyndon's now quickly dwindling wealth due to Barry's squandering.

Outwardly, Lord Bullingdon may seem to be the cause of Barry's fall, however, it may be more attributed to Barry being unable to adapt to any of the lives into which he is thrust to truly reach his goal of being a gentleman."

"Cannes Film Festival, 1975, Chronicle of the Burning Years by Mohamed Lakhdar-Hamina receives the Palme d'Or. This is a first for an African film. A meticulous chronicle of the evolution of the Algerian national movement from 1939 until the outbreak of the revolution on November 1, 1954, the film unequivocally demonstrates that the ""Algerian War"" is not an accident of history, but a slow process of revolts and suffering, uninterrupted, from the start of colonization in 1830, until this ""Red All Saints' Day"" of November 1, 54. Composed of six chapters, the film paints the merciless picture of political and warlike history of colonial Algeria. The result is grandiose. From the beauty of the ocher images of the desert to the light of the still faces, from the power of the crowd movements to the force of the subject, a broad fresco emerges, epic and lyrical at the same time, punctuated by droughts, famines, typhus and riots. At its center, Ahmed gradually awakens to political consciousness against colonization, under the gaze of his son, symbol of the new Algeria, and that of Miloud, half-mad haranguer, half-prophet, incarnation of popular memory of the revolt, the liberation of Algeria and its people. Lakhdar-Hamina will receive his Palme d'Or in a stormy atmosphere, triggering the awakening of the veterans of the OAS, fiercely nostalgic for French Algeria; who went so far as to threaten the filmmaker with death, and trigger a series of bomb threats throughout the festival. Never before had a film caused such a political scandal in France. Its restoration in 2021 reveals all its grandeur, technical and artistic, and its universal humanist scope."

"Dr. Jonathan Hemlock (Clint Eastwood) was a government assassin, who was sent to terminate, or as they call it ""sanction"" anyone who killed an American Agent. His former employer asks him to sanction two men who killed an Agent. When he refuses, his employer threatens to expose the artwork he has amassed with the money he earned working for them, to the I.R.S., knowing that he can't account for how he acquired them.

"The film presents three allegedly true stories of the supernatural. The first story, ""The Heptagon"", opens on a somber note at the funeral of college student Johnny Davis. His friends Dave, Frank and Randy are in attendance at the burial. It is revealed that they played a seemingly innocent phone prank on Johnny, telling him to go to a certain address where a date was waiting. The old woman who lived at the address accidentally shot Johnny to death. As the funeral service ends, Johnny's mother (who is the seventh daughter of a seventh son) recites a cryptic message to the three young men she blames for the death of her son: ""One by land, two by sky...seven times around go the three of you, and may your reward be just and true."" Later Frank relates this story to a priest, Father Duane, sitting next to him on a plane. He says that Dave was run over and killed seven days after the funeral. The priest tries to ease Frank's anxiety, assuring him that it's all a coincidence. However, after Father Duane exits the plane, it crashes upon takeoff. On the runway Father Duane attempts to comfort a dying Frank, who tells him that exactly fourteen days have passed since Johnny's burial. The troubled priest--beginning to suspect that there might be more to this pattern of deaths than mere chance--speaks to his superior, who suggests telephoning the remaining young man at the state university. Father Duane tries to call Randy but instead reaches his roommate, who tells him that Randy has gone skydiving. It is now twenty-one days after Johnny's burial, the narrator reminds us, and according to Mrs. Davis's prophecy, two of the young men would perish by sky."
"As the film opens, two young children are being brought to a beautiful orphanage in the countryside of California. The kids, named Tony Malone and his younger sister Tia, are warmly welcomed by the home's proprietor Mrs. Grindley, but make fast enemies with local bully, Truck. The children explain to Mrs. Grindley their background; when they were very small, they were adopted by an older couple named Mr. and Mrs. Malone. They have no memory of their parents, or really anything before being taken in by the Malones, though Tia has carried around a small box with two stars emblazoned on it for years, her ""star case"", and occasionally has obscure memory flashes to some kind of accident. Now that both of their adoptive parents have died, the pair have been sent to live in the orphanage.
Tony makes friends playing softball, while Tia befriends a black cat, which they name Winkie. While playing baseball, Tony makes an incredible leap to catch the ball and strike Truck out. Truck accuses Tony of cheating, and attempts to beat him up, but Tony stops him by making a baseball glove punch Truck, and levitating a bat so Truck strikes it and hurts his hand, while Tia looks at Tony with disapproval. The other kids stare at the pair, and Tia telepathically chastises Tony for showing off. That night in bed, Tia reminds Tony how they were looked upon as freaks by the other kids back in their old home, and even feared by the community until they stopped doing the ""spooky stuff"". The kids also realize that they can hear ""the dogs"" barking again, from miles away. They take this as an ill omen for times to come.
Some time later, all the children are awaiting a bus to go see a movie in town. Truck steals Tia's star case and threatens to destroy it unless Tony fights him for it, though Winkie knocks it out of Truck's hands and defuses the situation as the bus arrives. After the movie, Tia has a premonition of danger involving a man about to get into his car across the street. They separate from the group to warn him, and are collected by Mrs. Grindley. The man, named Mr. Deranian, decides to go for a walk instead, and moments later his car is plowed into by a runaway truck, exactly where Deranian would have been sitting. He stares in awe as the children leave.
Deranian returns to his employer, Aristotle Bolt, a millionaire who is obsessed with finding supernatural means of expanding his wealth. Deranian tells him of his encounter, and Bolt tells him to bring the children to him.
Tony is playing his harmonica to draw a picture of a place he's been having visions about. Tia walks in to show him her damaged star case, but while inspecting it, they find the front panel slides away to reveal a map to a unknown location, and landmarks ""Stony Creek"", and ""Misty Valley"". They determine to find their way there someday, as it may hold a clue to their past. Tia then notices the picture Tony is drawing, and they say that since they've never seen the mansion in the picture before, they must be going to it soon.
Deranian researches the two after finding out their names from the orphanage, and forges many documents, which he uses to prove to Mrs. Grindley that he is, in fact, Tony and Tia's uncle Lucas, claiming that he recognized Tia as looking like his sister. Tony and Tia are skeptical, but have no choice but to go with Deranian.
Dernanian takes the two far into the country, to Mr. Bolt's vast and gorgeous estate on the coast. As they drive in, they pass the gate guard, Loco, who has a severe allergic reaction on proximity to Winkie, and large kennels filled with guard dogs, that both Tia and Tony recognize as the source of the barking they heard before. Mr. Bolt plays the part of the gracious host, giving the children lavish living quarters as well as keeping them busy with a number of activities. During a riding lesson, Tia speaks to and rides a wild horse named Thunderhead, as the instructor looks on dumbfounded. Later, Tony uses his harmonica to make the marionettes in their room dance on their own. Little do they know that Mr. Bolt has been recording them on the CCTV cameras installed all over the property, intending to blackmail the children using the tapes.
One night, Tony notices Tia seems upset. Although she is unable to pinpoint why, as they seem to have gotten everything they've ever wanted. Tony admits to also feeling as if something is wrong. Tia tells Tony that she has had visions of Bolt turning on them and never letting them leave, and tells him they should consider running away. Tony reluctantly agrees.
While having dinner with Mr. Bolt and Deranian, Bolt runs out of patience and reveals to the children that he knows about their powers, against Deranian's advice. Tony and Tia feign ignorance, but can tell he isn't lying. Bolt tells them he wants to understand their powers, and use them to help his business efforts. The two tell him that he is not thinking clearly and needs some rest, and he leaves with Deranian. Tony and Tia are shaken at the revelation, and discuss what to do. Telepathically, they hear Bolt talking to Deranian, saying that if the children don't cooperate, he will have them sent to a secluded island in the middle of a freezing ocean to prevent them from escaping. Tia and Tony decide to run away that night, and try to find their way to the place on the star case map.
After they are 'asleep', and Deranian locks their bedroom door for the night, they put their plan into action. Fully dressed and ready to go, they take Winkie, and Tia unlocks the door with ease. They take a back door out of the mansion and make it outside before alarms begin to blare throughout the compound and the dogs are set loose. They run and make it as far as the gate before the dogs catch up, but Tia empathically tells them to chase their handlers instead, then calls Thunderhead to their aid. Tony tries to use his harmonica to open the gate, but Loco is holding it closed. Winkie jumps into the guard booth, causing Loco to sneeze uncontrollably and release the gate lever. Tony opens the gate, and they all get away on Thunderhead.
Bolt is furious, and asserts all of his power in the area to find the children, including state police. The kids make it to town, and see a Winnebago Motor Home parked outside a store. They hide inside the RV as the crotchety driver, Jason O'Day, loads up to leave for a road trip. Deranian drives by and asks Jason if he has seen the runaways, but Jason tells him to shove off, and drives the RV away.
The next morning, Jason pulls into a beach and gets out to stretch his legs. Winkie finds her way out, knocking a bag of flour onto the children as she does. Jason finds Winkie and takes a liking to her, but when he goes inside the RV to get tuna, he finds Tony and Tia hiding inside. He evicts them from his RV, but takes pity on them and tells them to clean up while he makes them some food. Tia tells Tony that despite his grouchy attitude and professed dislike of kids, she can tell he is a good person.
State Police all over are searching for the children, and Deranian suspects that they might be hiding in the Winnebago he saw the previous night. They begin to search for the RV specifically.
The kids explain their situation to Jason, who is skeptical. When Jason realizes he's lost his keys, they prove their powers to him by starting his engine without them, and having Winkie find his keys on the beach. In exchange, they convince him to take them to Stony Creek.
Jason takes the RV to a gas station for supplies, but the pump attendant is acting suspicious. They leave, and when the children take note of how many provisions Jason got, he tells them the trip might not be as straight forward as they hope, as Bolt is an extremely powerful man in these parts. Just then a State Trooper on motorcycle shows up on their tail, tipped off by the gas station attendant. He pulls them over and gets off his bike, but before he can approach the Winnebago, Tony telekenetically sends his cycle over the cliff, and they drive away. Tia's memory flashes of the accident they were in when the Malones took them in have been becoming more frequent. They become clear enough for he to tell that it had something to do with the ocean, and a trawler like Mr. Malone had.
Mr. Bolt calls the Sheriff of a town called Longview, and tells him a reward has been offered for the children's capture, and to be on the lookout as the RV has been seen heading that direction.
The group stops for the night in a secluded campground. Jason is becoming fond of the children, and helps them decipher the landmarks on their map. The kids suspect that the place in the mountains might be where they came from, though Tia has a feeling that it was further away then that. Jason and the kids wonder why whoever gave them the star case would hide the map so well. Jason mentions in passing that he never married, but Tia reveals that to be false, stunning Jason. Both children explain that they can see from his mind his life before, how when he was a young man, he married a beautiful woman who died just a few months after they were wed, leaving Jason in despair. He swore an oath never to love anyone ever again, hence his outwardly gruff demeanor. Jason is momentarily upset at these old memories, and the children apologize for prying.
In the middle of the night, Deranian and his driver Ubermann are coming the area and spot the RV in the woods. they attempt to sneak up on them, gun drawn, but Winkie hears them coming and knocks the gun from Ubermann's hand, waking the group. Tia telekenetically holds the gun on Deranian and Ubermann, while Jason starts the RV and drives away. Deranian gives chase, and Jason tells Tony and Tia to jump out at the next town, Longview, to split up and lose their pursuers. He tells them to meet him at his brother's house outside of town. They turn a corner and Tony and Tia jump out of the RV and run another direction, while Deranian's car follows Jason. Tia and Tony make their way through the town in the dark, but are ambushed by the Sheriff, who witnessed the ruse.
He takes them to the station and confiscates their items, but when he takes down their names, Tony instinctively answers with the last name ""Castaway"", confusing himself and Tia. The Sheriff locks them up as runaways, and Tia says she thinks Tony said Castaway as a translation from another language, perhaps their original last name. Tia remembers a man named Uncle Bene was with them when they wrecked. He gave Tia the star case, but drowned while keeping them afloat. They hear the Sheriff tell his deputy that Deranian is on his way to collect to children, and Tony asks Tia to levitate his harmonica to him. They easily unlock the cell door, and Tony telekenetically makes a figure out of a broom handle, trench coat, and hat to attack the Sheriff as a distraction. They grab to star case and escape to the woods, but not before Tia frees a caged circus bear that she says needed her help. The terrified Sheriff rallies the townsmen to hunt down the pair, claiming that they are witches. Deranian arrives in the middle of the chaos and is worried the bloodthirsty townsfolk will kill the children.
Tia and Tony meanwhile, have made it to the forest. They tell the bear to hide in a cave while they make their way to Jason's brother's house. The townsmen search the cave looking for the kids, but the bear scares them away. The kids finally make it to the house and meet up with Jason and Winkie, but Deranian and Ubermann are on their trail and radio Bolt.
Tia and Tony fill Jason in on what they've remembered so far. They both remember that they are supposed to find someone named Castaway in Stony Creek. They realize the accident must have been on a ship from another country, since they didn't understand English when the Malones adopted them. But they can't remember where the ship could have come from. Jason his brother wrote to him in his letters about a group of people who had settled into a secluded place called Witch Mountain, above Stony Creek. The people there keep to themselves, and no one knows where they came from. Tony and Tia figure that they must be their people. Bolt leaves via helicopter to join the Deranian at the house.
The group sees Deranian and Ubermann approaching, and leave via the back door while Tia telepathically asks the bear for help. They drive off and Deranian attempts to follow, but finds the bear sitting in his car.
While driving, Tia and Tony remember more details about their past. The night their ship sank, many other people died as well as their uncle Bene. There were multiple ships however, and the survivors made it to their destination on Witch Mountain. They all fled there from a place that doesn't exist anymore, hence why they call themselves 'Castaways'. The two stars on the star case was the emblem of their old home, a place with two suns in the sky. Not another country, but in fact an entirely different planet, in another solar system. All the pieces of memory finally fit together. Their world was dying, and the remaining population boarded spaceships to escape and find a new home. Tony and Tia's ship got caught in a storm and was destroyed, and Uncle Bene helped the children survive long enough to be rescued by the Malones, who took them in. They suspect that they are the only ones on their spaceship who made it.
Bolt arrives in his helicopter to the house, which scare the bear away. Deranian explains the situation to Bolt, and goes to follow the RV.
Jason and the kids arrive in Stony Creek, but the town seems deserted. They go to a building marked Misty Valley Cooprative, and decide to wait for someone to come back.
Deranian finds the search party from Longview, and tells them the reward for the children as gone up, but they must be caught alive. One of the searchers suggests they look in the next town up the line; Stony Creek.
Jason and the kids are getting restless waiting, and Tony suddenly has a feeling to check the phone book. He looks up the name Castaway and dials the number. The man on the other end of the phone rejoices when he hears Tony and Tia's names, but just then Deranian arrives with the townsmen.
The voice on the phone tells Tony to take the back door, which they do. Once outside, the children hear the voice again, this time telepathically, telling them to make sure Deranian doesn't lose them, as he has a surprise waiting for him that will discourage him and Bolt from ever looking for them again. A chase ensues up the mountain, and the kids manage to hold of some of their pursuers. Deranian takes a shortcut and attempts to head them off, but somehow the RV flies into the air right over him. The force making this happen also makes Bolt's helicopter fly upside down next to them, which flabbergasts Bolt. The RV comes to a landing on Witch Mountain, and the voice tells the group to get out and wait.
The kids thank Jason for all he's done, and say goodbye. Jason has become very fond of them, and asks if he could think of them as the kids he never had. Tia also asks him to take Winkie, since Jason needs a companion. The source of the voice emerges from the treeline, and the children recognize the man as their uncle Bene; he'd apparently not drowned in the storm, but survived after empathically asking a passing shark for help. Bene praises Jason as a credit to his species, and explains that there were other young survivors that are still missing, all with star cases and maps. So far, only Tony and Tia have made it. Jason vows to try and find the other surviving children and bring them home. Deranian arrives in his car, and Bolt's helicopter comes to a landing, still upside down. Bene tells them it's time to go. They children bid farewell to Jason and go with Bene. They board a flying saucer, which takes off in front of Bolt, out of his reach forever. He and Deranian leave defeated.
After Bolt leaves, the spaceship comes back and flies over Jason and Winkie into the Misty Valley of Witch Mountain to join the colony."

"Welles' take on filmmaking is as a form of trickery and fakery by editing different parts of other documentary footage on a famous forger Elmyr de Hory, being interviewed by the famous biographer of Howard Hughes, Clifford Irving. De Hory claimed that he never painted a picture by a famous artist, that he offered to a museum, that they didn't buy, and Irving was advanced $800,000 thousand dollars for an autobiography of the reclusive Howard Hughes which was completely false. Welles begins F for Fake by performing several magic tricks and claiming that filmmaking is prestidigitation and tricks the viewer into seeing something that the viewer willfully accepts. The filmmaker cites his own rise to stardom as a trickster by claiming that his first entrance on the scene was with a fake radio program about invasion from Mars. As the film follows de Hory and his development as a forger, it also follows Clifford Irving as a close associate of de Hory as evidence of how Orson Welles' formula for stardom reads, regardless of what the artist does with his art."

The three, who plan to live together, will masquerade as an extended family under assumed surnames, Freddie and Oscar indeed married, with Nicky Freddie's brother, while behind closed doors Oscar will be the platonic third wheel in Nicky and Freddie's love nest. Although he is purportedly doing it for love, Nicky really wants access to Freddie's money, she being an heiress to a fortune about which Nicky tries to convince Oscar is untrue.

Such hydrogen-powered airships, built by Frankfurt-based Zeppelin, are flouted by the Nazis as a symbol of their global power, despite Zeppelin officials largely and openly not being Nazi supporters. Although the Germans have received crank reports of such before, they believe that a letter they receive from Kathie Rauch of Milwaukee stating that a time bomb will explode aboard the Hindenburg while flying over American soil to be genuine in its threat because of the specificity of her claims. As such, the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda, which corroborates that the letter's claims support their own intelligence, employs Luftwaffe Colonel Franz Ritter to act ""quietly"" as chief of security for the next Germany to US flight, when the explosion is to occur. The Nazis do not know that Ritter is not a supporter of their policies, he who would leave the German military if he could, but he does tell them that he believes such airships, even the Hindenburg, to be ""flying dinosaurs"". What the Nazis don't tell him but what he learns once on board is that the Gestapo have also enlisted an operative, Martin Vogel, for that flight, he who is undercover as the staff photographer. Ritter and Vogel are often at odds with each other on the approach to take on the process of identifying and dealing with a bomber. Although Mrs. Rauch is ultimately identified as a crackpot, Ritter does believe that there truly is a bomber on board, based on evidence he and Vogel collect of the disparate group of passengers and the crew, many of who seem to have the ability or motive to blow up the Hindenburg. What Ritter decides to do is based largely on his anti-Nazi feelings, but his actions may be compromised by Vogel's own strong Nazi leanings."

"Harry Moseby is a former pro football player turned Los Angeles-based private investigator, who owns his own independent firm. What he thought was his stable marriage to high-end antiques gallery manager Ellen Moseby is not, when he finds out she has been having an affair. Although she still loves Harry, Ellen believes his work - especially having to do all his own legwork in his independent agency, as opposed to working for a larger private investigation firm - is overtaking his life and their marriage. This revelation is bad timing for Harry as he starts on a new case, to locate two-week missing sixteen-year-old Delly Grastner for her mother, twice-divorced Arlene Iverson, a former bit actress. Beyond the job itself, Harry can see that Arlene's motives are not motherly love. He eventually learns that Arlene, who lives well, achieved what little success she had in the business by sleeping with the right people, and that the probable reason that she wants Delly back is that her daughter's sizable trust fund set up by Arlene's first husband, Delly's late father, is Arlene's sole means of support. When Harry believes he discovers not only Delly's reasons for running away but also to where she was running in achieving her goal, he changes the complexity of the case solely from missing person to possibly smuggling, attempted murder and multiple homicide, which have far more inherent dangers to himself. All the while, he still grapples with what to do about the broken state of his marriage."

"In the building physician's office, Dr. St. Luc seems indifferent to the amorous advances from his nurse, Miss Forsythe. They are interrupted by the telephone. Linsky calls St. Luc from Hobbes office downtown where he found Hobbes notes, which far exceed their original project. According to Linsky reading one paper, Hobbes wrote: ""Man is an animal who thinks too much"", and had a vision about creating a parasite which was ""a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease that will hopefully turn the world into one mindless orgy"". He was also using Annabelle as a guinea pig for his experiment and that he infected with a parasite through sexual contact but when she got out of control he killed her since she could infect others with the parasites. St. Luc tells Linsky that apparently Annabelle was very sexually active and infected three or four men at Starliner Towers and explains about the few cases of stomach lumps already and mentions that Janine Tudor's husband may have been one of Annabelle's sexual partners. Linsky arranges to meet them later in Tudor's apartment to confirm and warns St. Luc about encountering anyone at the building complex behaving in a strange way."

"Veeru and Jai fight back and send a message back to Gabbar: For every villager killed by Gabbar, Veeru and Jai will avenge them by killing four of his men in return. Gabbar, angered by this, swears death on Jai, Veeru, the Thakur, and all of Ramgarh.
The battle approaches its climax when Basanti and Veeru are captured and Jai follows. As Basanti is forced to dance by Gabbar to keep Veeru alive, Jai steadily gets through Gabbar's defences. Soon Jai is able to get into a position to shoot Gabbar and demands the release of his friends. Veeru and Basanti escape while Jai holds back the dacoits from a distance with a rifle. Once Veeru and Basanti are safe, Jai slowly draws back and heads for his friends, only to be wounded grievously by a bullet as he is running away.
Jai is reunited with Veeru and Basanti where they realise they are running out of ammunition. As Veeru is unaware of Jai's wound, Jai orders him to go back to the village where he can take Basanti and then return with ammo. Veeru does not want Jai to face the bandits alone, so he suggests that Jai should go. The two dispute once more and resort to what has been their only method of resolution over the years - the coin. As it was earlier in the film, Veeru loses the toss and goes back to the village.
Jai, slowly dying and with only a few bullets, manages to fend off advances by the bandits, who have hidden under a small bridge and have thrown a stick of dynamite that has failed to explode. Jai manages to get close enough to the dynamite and uses his last bullet to detonate it, taking out the bridge and most of Gabbar's men.
Veeru returns to find Jai dying and sadly talks with him before he dies in his arms. Some of the villagers rush to the scene, including Radha, who once again must endure the anguish of losing someone. As Veeru wipes a tear, he notices Jai's old coin in his hand and then it dawns on him that he had been tricked by Jai all along. The coin was double-headed and Jai had managed to manipulate every situation that they disagreed on to his favour. Angry at his friend for sacrificing his life to save him, Veeru becomes hell-bent on revenge and goes after Gabbar.
Veeru catches Gabbar and beats him up badly, about to finish him off. But before he can kill him, the Thakur appears and reminds him of the promise to bring Gabbar to him - alive. Veeru is ready to break his word to avenge Jai when he is told that it was Jai who made the promise. Unwilling to break Jai's promise, Veeru hands Gabbar over to the Thakur who reveals his spike-soled shoes, made to make Gabbar beg for a quick death."

"For the seventh year in a row, the Santa Rosa Jaycees are organizing the California edition of the American Junior Miss beauty pageant, this year with much of the same organizers as previous years. The thirty-odd contestants include the regular mix of confident girls, gregarious girls, shy girls, naive girls and backstabbing girls, but they all have the same goal of wanting to win and saying and doing what they believe the judges want to hear and see. But those behind the scenes are looking for their own two pounds of flesh either from the pageant and/or from the girls themselves, including a penny-pinching producer, a musical director who just doesn't understand the limitations of the girls, an egotistical and highly paid choreographer, a self-indulgent maintenance crew and the sex obsessed and entrepreneurial spirited teenage son of a pageant official. Add to the mix the former beauty queen pageant supervisor who is hiding a dysfunctional marriage and the pageant head judge who sees this job as bringing up his standing in the community, and this year's edition of the pageant may proceed a little differently than past years, especially as both do whatever it takes to avoid scandal."

"A serial killer has been terrorizing a community, his five victims thus far being young women all with some form of disability. Lieutenant Fields, leading the case, wants to show that he is keeping the community safe by his reckless actions. Within a certain circle, the focus moves to the Sherman mansion owned by Dr. Joe Sherman, the mansion, the family home, out of which he operates the Sherman Institute, an educational organization. That focus is because Helen Mallory, Joe her paternal uncle, has been ""vacationing"" there, it a euphemism for recuperating as she became mute due to a mental break in having watched her husband and her adolescent daughter die in a house fire, and as she is the girlfriend of Dr. Rawley, the Sherman family doctor and the medical examiner. Dr. Rawley and many in the family fear for Helen's life as a potential next victim.

Although she supports her husband, Jerri is uncertain about trucking as a long term career as she doesn't want CJ constantly on the road, especially when they start a family, which they both hope will be sooner than later, but which they both realize won't be until they are firmly on their feet, meaning paying off the loan.

While the relationship between the Pedecarises and Raisuli shifts during the Pedicarises captivity, the nature of the situation changes in its entirety when Raisuli divulges his true intention with them, which has to do with Morocco's tenuous geopolitical situation especially in relation to multiple European colonializing forces wanting their hold on Morocco, and as US President"

"Vera Baxter (played by Claudine Gabay) is a married woman with children who ""lies a lot"" (as she says several times); to herself as much as to others. We learn that Vera follows around her husband Jean in what initially seems to be an odd but functional relationship, where he travels to a new town, rents a place and has affairs with young women. Vera always rents a place nearby, keeping the kids and having momentary affairs herself once in a blue moon, out of loneliness. Vera just had an affair with Michael Cayre (Gerard Depardieu), who has followed her to the new flat she's considering renting because he's fallen in love with her, but Vera isn't responding to his calls. We learn the inklings of all this at a bar where a Cayre, a lady bystander (only named L'inconnue; The Unknown) and Monique (one of Jean Baxter's lovers) are talking.
Monique arrives at the villa and has a casual but intense chat with Vera. They speak of themselves and their relationships with Jean. It's revealed that Monique has been sent there by Jean (who unknown to Monique, is busy entertaining a different young lady) to tell Vera that he's supposedly going on vacation to Spain with Monique, and not take Vera this time. Vera informs Monique this isn't the first time she's heard such a promise, and Monique leaves. Vera phones her husband Jean (played in voice only by François Périer), and the conversation turns to her suggesting divorce, which Jean seems distressed by but unable to address in any practical way.
L'inconnue (Delphine Seyrig) arrives at the villa and overhears the majority of the conversation before Vera hangs up. At first the woman says she's been sent by Cayre to bring Vera back to the bar, but things really open up when she points out that Vera can tell her anything, as they don't know one another and any secrets will be kept. Vera once again launches into a story of half-truths, which the visitor easily sees through. By pointedly questioning Vera, and information L'inconnue learned from her chat with Cayre at the bar earlier, the woman helps Vera see that Jean is a contemptible cad who's been using his wife to keep his failing building business ventures afloat. In fact, Jean owed a gambling debt to Cayre, and offered a night with his wife as payment. It's soon implied that all Vera's affairs have been as controlled by her husband as every other aspect of her life. Vera asks to be left alone but L'inconnue says she heard Vera admit to considering suicide during the phone conversation, and so won't leave. Vera gazes longingly at the views of the sea outside the villa and uncovers the visitor's lie that Cayre is still at the bar waiting for her return; when he's actually left from the shame of the arrangement that made them met in the first place. Then she asks why the woman is doing this. The visitor says that when she first heard the name 'Vera Baxter', she felt she wanted to be the woman that name belonged to. Though Cayre is gone, Vera now knows that another kind of love exists in the world, and a kindness that even the visitor seems capable of. They walk through the villa and with truth alive and lies put to bed, Vera decides to leave and find out what the outside world will be like beyond the protective but corrupting influence of her husband."

Frannie is killed in an accident, but his death and that of the three women he killed is pinned on Jerry, who goes on the run from the police. When Jerry reads in the news of another man who seemed to go through much of what Frannie did and who murdered his family before being killed himself, Jerry goes on a search for answers as to what happened to Frannie to make him turn psychotic, and if Frannie's affliction is related to this other man. By Jerry's side on the sidelines is his friend David - who only knew Frannie distantly through Jerry - and Jerry's girlfriend, Alicia Sweeney, who knows Jerry is innocent. Through his search, Jerry believes that everything points to activities of Ed Flemming ten years ago at Stanford University, activities which he would deny as it would ruin his election chances, and something called Blue Sunshine. Regardless of Ed Flemming's cooperation or not, Jerry tries primarily to clear his name and find out what's happening so that he can stop further murders from occurring."

"The film opens with a carnival in Venice as a prelude to a series of erotic encounters that follow Giacomo Casanova through the cities of 18th-century Europe. The organizers of the festival attempt to raise a gigantic bust from the water; this fails, which is taken as a bad omen. Casanova is then introduced, as he visits one of Venice's islands to copulate with a fake nun for the pleasure of a rich voyeur; Casanova succeeds in entertaining him, but is frustrated that the man finds no interest in his research into alchemy and his further scheming. As he rows back to the mainland, Casanova is arrested, judged and imprisoned by the High Court over his famed debauchery. During his time in prison, Casanova reminisces of his affairs with a dressmaker and later on with one of her junior employees, Anna Maria, who suffers from frequent fainting and requires constant bloodletting. He eventually consummates his desire for Anna Maria. Back in prison, Casanova escapes through the roof and exiles himself from Venice, being taken into the Paris court of Madame d'Urfé. The Madame, an aged woman, enthralled by Casanova's apparent knowledge of alchemy, wishes to transform her soul into a man's through ritualistic intercourse with him (an act that requires the presence of a younger woman in the room, so that Casanova can get aroused). Fortuitously, Casanova encounters his brother, whose girlfriend he entices away. Casanova then moves to the court of a hunchback, Du Bois, in between taking charge of a beautiful girl-""the love of his life""-Henriette. Du Bois puts on a homosexual theatrical performance for his guests that unsettles some of them; Casanova is brought to tears as Henriette plays some music. The lovers vow fidelity to each other, but the following morning Henriette has disappeared. Du Bois informs Casanova that an emissary of a far-away court has reclaimed Henriette, and she's left a request that Casanova not attempt to follow her. While in London, Casanova is robbed by two women and he attempts suicide by drowning himself in the Thames. A vision of a giantess and two dwarfs distracts him; he follows them to a frost fair, where he arm-wrestles the giantess-a princess-and later pays to watch her bathe with the dwarfs. Casanova resumes his travelling the following day. He attends a deranged party at Lord Talou's palace in Rome, where he wins a bet with a stagecoach driver, Righetto, over how many orgasms he can have in one hour. The competition brings him higher acclaim. In Switzerland he falls in love with an alchemist's daughter, Isabella, who fails to keep an appointment to go to Dresden with him; Casanova instead partakes in an orgy within the hostel he's been stranded in. In Dresden, he has a brief chance encounter with his estranged mother in a theater. He then moves to a court in Württemberg, where his desire to be taken seriously as a writer/inventor is frustrated by the court's orgiastic, wild nature. It is here that he meets Rosalba, a mechanical doll with whom he shares a dance and later on goes to bed with. Time goes by and an old Casanova finds himself librarian to Count Waldstein at his castle in Dux. Life at the castle is more than frustrating for Casanova, as he is made to eat with other servants and does not get the respect nor the food he claims to deserve. Waldstein's manservant, Faulkircher, and his lover Vidarol, make him an object of mockery and animosity. A portrait of him is hanged and defecated on. Later on, during a fervent poetry recital, a court member fails to suppress a giggle at Casanova, who, humiliated and disappointed, goes back up to his room. The final scene has a weary, bloodshot Casanova cringing in an armchair and recounting a recent dream. In this dream, Casanova is back in Venice. He catches a glimpse of the giant bust seen in the beginning of the film, buried under thick layers of ice in the lagoon. He chases the ghosts of his past lovers, all of whom disappear. An ornate stagecoach beckons him to join its passengers. He finally meets with Rosalba, the mechanical doll, once again. They quietly dance with each other."

When she sarcastically congratulates MacKenzie on ""quarantining"" the passengers for good, telling him that maybe there were survivors, he tells her that the oxygen pumped into the train would have generated an explosion that killed everybody, including the appointed military guards. Stradner, disgusted, is only able to say, ""I see"", finally aware that his goal all along was to have them killed to contain the disease.

It's a lie, but Hammond puts Blaise in chains and decides to have him castrated for the alleged rape. In fact, the best way to castrate a slave is a conversation topic at the dinner party that has been arranged to celebrate Hammond and Augusta's engagement; Bernard is a guest. During the party Drum frees Blaise from his chains, and the other slaves launch a violent uprising. Bernard shoots Blaise during the fighting and Drum grabs Bernard's privates and rips them off.

"Following a rough chronology from 1884 to 1894, when Norwegian artist Edvard Munch began expressionism and established himself as northern Europe's most maligned and controversial artist, the film also flashes back to the death from consumption of his mother, when he was five, his sister's death, and his near death at 13 from pulmonary disease. The film finds enduring significance in Munch's brief affair with ""Mrs. Heiberg"" and his participation in the café society of anarchist Hans Jaeger in Christiania and later in Berlin with Strindberg. Through it all comes Munch's melancholy and his desire to render on canvas, cardboard, paper, stone, and wood his innermost feelings."

"Wealthy and aged Julia Rainbird wants to bequeath her vast fortune to her only presumed living heir, her illegitimate nephew, who was given away as a baby and as such whose whereabouts and identity she does not know. Rather than go to a private investigator to locate him, a P.I. who would use public means to do his work, Julia instead enlists the more discreet services of her psychic, Madame Blanche, to locate her nephew, with a payment of $10,000 upon delivery. What Julia is unaware of is that Madame Blanche - really Blanche Tyler - is a charlatan, who uses basic information of her targets often uncovered by her actor/taxi driving boyfriend, George Lumley, to perpetrate the scam. Blanche and George feel this $10,000 is their meal ticket, despite having only scant leads as to the identity and whereabouts of the nephew. Their initial leads indicate that the nephew may in fact be dead... or perhaps not. In reality, the nephew is Arthur Adamson, a jeweler, who, along with his secret associate/girlfriend Fran, have amassed their own small fortune through the theft of gems, largely through kidnapping the gem owners, with the said gems being the ransom paid. Arthur grew up as Edward Shoebridge, the adopted son of friends of the Rainbird's chauffeur. Along with another associate, Edward killed his parents in a house fire twenty-five years ago, and faked his own death in the process, although he had never been declared legally dead since there was no conclusive evidence of such. He assumed his current identity after the fire. When Arthur learns that these strangers, George and Blanche, are trying to locate Edward Shoebridge but not knowing the reason, Arthur and Fran believe it's because of their latest kidnapping, and thus decide they need to do whatever, including murder, to keep George and Blanche from finding ""Eddie""."

"). Once this spell is performed on Johan and Peewit, they awaken in a beautiful forest in the Land of the Smurfs. They meet one of the Smurfs, a tiny blue humanoid creature (just like the ones who tried to retrieve the flute), roughly 5 to 6 inches tall, wearing white pants & working cap. (And most of the time he speaks, a magic chime is heard in his voice.) The Smurf takes our two heroes to the Smurf Village, and find that the Smurfs are all nearly identical in appearance (and are 100 years old), except for their patriarch, Papa Smurf (who is 542), who has a white beard and wears red pants & cap in lieu of white, and the houses they live in are big mushrooms, the tallest ones are nearly as big as Johan. In the Smurfs' own language, nouns and verbs are replaced with the word ""smurf."" Putting it in song, Papa Smurf states that although all the Smurfs look the same, they can each be identified by their personalities, and introduces nearly a dozen of them: Greedy Smurf, Poet Smurf, Farmer Smurf, Lazy Smurf, Handy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf, Festive Smurf, Grouchy Smurf, the bespectacled Brainy Smurf (the only Smurf to look remotely different from the rest), and Hefty Smurf. Returning to urgent affairs, Johan asks Papa Smurf for a way to break the magic effect of the flute. While he regrets that is impossible, he has a better idea: to build a new magic flute, so Peewit can fight with Oilycreep on equal terms. The Smurfs get to work immediately, and all through the night, they chop down a special tree in the forest (at the center of which is the part needed to make the flute). While the Smurfs get to work on carving the flute from the wood, a song number ensues in which a bored Peewit realizes that he can ask for a glass of water as ""a smurf of smurf."" Johan is laughing in amusement at this, as the Smurfs cannot understand him, and bring him the wrong things, until they finally give him a glass of water, upon which a stressed-out Peewit angrily changes his mind! A while later, the new flute is finished, but Festive Smurf wants to throw a big party for their hard work, which they do, later that night, in the Smurf Village. After a very cheerful party with music, fireworks, and food, Papa Smurf is just about to give Johan and Peewit the new flute, until they are suddenly awakened from their sleep too soon by Homnibus, who was very worried, as they were asleep for 2 days! When they demand to be sent back, Homnibus tries the spell again, but is exhausted from his efforts and gets a headache, for which he must get rest. While Oliver tends to the wizard, Johan and Peewit are frustrated, worried about what Oilycreep is doing at that moment..."

Unmotivated in life, Howard Prince works as the night cashier in a diner, he squandering whatever little money he earns and more on bad investments, mostly of the gambling kind, he thus in debt to a number of people. He is approached by his childhood friend Alfred Miller, a successful television script writer, who has just been blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), Alfred who had never hid his Communist sympathies since well before the government witch-hunt through HUAC. Knowing that writing under a pseudonym would not work to get writing jobs, Alfred asks Howard to be his writing front i.e. Alfred would write the scripts for the network show for which he was working for producer Phil Sussman, and Howard would submit them under his name for a ten percent cut, Phil none the wiser. Beyond Howard needing to learn how to seem credible as a writer to Phil and others, Alfred sees Howard as the perfect person for this job in this era as someone who HUAC would never investigate in he being overtly non-political. Beyond the money, Howard agrees purely in an act of friendship. But as Howard as Alfred's front becomes entrenched in the world of network television as a success, and now swayed by the money, Howard gets Alfred to convince two of his other blacklisted writing friends to let him act as their fronts for the same percentage cut. In the process, Howard meets two people who would influence him in this work. One is Florence Barrett, the show's story editor, who doesn't much like what the blacklist is doing to the business especially in being ""left"" leaning herself. She and Howard fall for each other, Florence's attraction to him in large part because of his insightful scripts. And two is comedian Hecky Brown, who doesn't know what to do about HUAC as he previously had some connection to left wing activities solely to impress a girl, HUAC who wants him to name names or find out others who HUAC may suspect as Communists, with he blacklisted if he doesn't cooperate. The blacklist is more devastating to actors than writers if only because actors cannot get a front to be them. Howard's relationship with the two will influence what he decides to do when, due solely to his increasing success leading to a covert investigation, he is asked to testify to HUAC."

"Michael Bannon, the wealthy but restless president of New York based Richter Chocolate and Confections, secretly issuing the code word ""gumball"" to those in the know across the country signifies that interested parties are to convene in New York City for the next Gumball Rally, an approximate one and a half day illegal motor vehicle race from a hidden New York City garage to the Queen Mary parking lot at Long Beach, California. There is only one rule for the race: there are no rules. The race was initiated and is organized by Mike and his twenty year best friend and competitor Steve Smith - Smitty - who will this year have as the seconds in their respective vehicles Samuel Graves, a Boston university tenure track Classics professor who is worried about getting caught which would threaten his tenure, and Italian race car driver Franco Bertollini, who arguably has the opposite sex on his mind more than the race. One hopeful new entrant this year is Jose, the car-less gopher at the garage and the race starter, who not only wants to show his overbearing aspiring actress girlfriend Angie that he has a car - a stipulation she has before she will go on anymore dates with him - but also to get her to Hollywood. What happens during the race will be a combination of skill, perseverance, luck, motivation, priorities and a little improvisation on the run. Someone who may factor into the results is LAPD's exasperated Lieutenant Roscoe, who for years, along with police forces he has co-opted across the country, has tried to nail specifically Mike and Smitty on some legality to get them out of the race business, which he has so far been unable to do as Mike and Smitty always seem to have the leg up on him. As this may be Roscoe's last year as he inches toward retirement, he would see success on this front as a crown in his retirement."

"In the summer 1973, the coal miners working at the Brookside Mine, located in Brookside, Harlan County, Kentucky and owned by the Eastover Coal Company, voted to join the union, United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), against the wishes of Eastover administrators. Shortly thereafter, the miners went out on strike on Eastover and its parent company, Duke Power Company, refusing to sign a contract with its employees, union members. Beyond the direct economic issues of wages and benefits, the miners' grievances included long standing inherent problems with the coal mining industry in the United States in general, such as health issues most specifically with black lung from inhaling coal dust, and other more acute dangers, an explosion at Consolidated Coal's Mannington Mine in Farmington, West Virginia a few years earlier which killed seventy-eight of eighty-two people working in the mine itself at the time. The company was granted an injunction prohibiting the strikers from blocking vehicles from entering/exiting the mine site and from calling the replacement workers hired ""scabs"". Emotions on both sides ramped up as the strike progressed, with wives and other miner supporters joining the strikers on the picket lines, and the potential for violence, most specifically gun violence, becoming more blatant. Discussions of a no-strike clause as a possible item within a contract became the most contentious issue. But other problems within the UMWA, which led to an indictment for murder, and the UMWA's contractual relationship to the Bituminous Coal Operators Association (BCOA) would also be factors. But a tragedy would be the turning point in the divisive strike, which hearkened back to similar such struggles in the area during the great depression."
"It's 1892. Harry Dighby and Walter Hill are a Massachusetts-based third-rate vaudeville team and penny-ante con artists who pilfer money from audience members to supplement their meager income. They often feud with each other because of their differing perspectives and personalities, but they both have the same primary goal of making it big in vaudeville. Adam Worth is a renowned New York City socialite and ladies' man who also robs banks, the latest being the Lowell Bank and Trust. He has a standing agreement with New York City bank Presidents that after the robberies, he keeps the cash, but returns the securities for a fifteen percent face-value fee minus a modest commission for the bank President. Harry and Walter meet Adam when they are assigned cellmates during their incarceration at Concord Prison for their latest crimes. As Adam manages to arrange to continue living lavishly in prison, Harry and Walter become his manservants. They learn that Adam has a copy of the blueprints for the redesigned Lowell Bank and Trust, now reported to be the most impenetrable financial institution. Adam plans to rob the bank again to satisfy his ego that he can do it, but also to get back at the bank's President, Rufus T. Crisp, who was responsible for his capture.

"Handsomely-mounted historical epic concerns the birth of the
Islamic faith and the story of the prophet Mohammed -- who, in
accordance with the tenants of Islam, is never to be depicted (as this is against certain Islamic schools of thought). In Mecca in the 7th century, Mohammed is visited by a
vision of the Angel Gabriel, who urges him to lead the people of
Mecca to cast aside the 300 idols of Kaaba and instead worship the
one true God, speaking out against the corrupt political and military
leaders who rule Mecca. With the help of his uncle, a brave warrior
named Hamza (Anthony Quinn), Mohammed and his followers return
to Mecca to liberate the city in the name of God. The Message
(originally screened in the U.S. as Mohammed, Messenger of God)
proved to be highly controversial during its production and initial
release. Unfounded rumors had it that Mohammed would not only be
depicted in the film, but that he was to be played by Charlton Heston
or Peter O'Toole. This resulted in protests by some Muslim, until director Moustapha Akkad hired a staff of respected Islamic clerics as technical advisors. The Message was shot in two
versions, one in English and one in Arabic (entitled Al-Ris-Alah), with
different actors taking over some of the roles due to language
requirements."

"Elaine May crafted a gangster film like no other in the nocturnal odyssey Mikey and Nicky, capitalizing on the chemistry between frequent collaborators John Cassavetes and Peter Falk by casting them together as small-time mobsters whose lifelong relationship has turned sour.

"One day, when smashing dolls and licking up catsup doesn't seem to satisfy him anymore, Mosquito breaks into a mortuary where he stabs the corpse of a young woman and licks her blood off his hands, whereafter he writes ""Mosquito"" on the wall. This appears to satisfy whatever is driving him, as he continues the practice of locating dead girls from the obituaries, stabbing them in the chest, and drinking their blood, eventually using a double-pronged straw to suck it directly instead of licking it off his hands. Occasionally he goes a bit further, like cutting off a woman's head and, in one case, plucking out a woman's eyeballs and taking them home where he keeps them in a jar. After several such mutilations, Mosquito's exploits have made it into the newspaper and all
of Nuremberg is talking about the ""vampire""."

The dinner part of the invitation runs into problems due to the non-communication between Twain's blind butler, Jamesir Bensonmum (Sir Alec Guinness), and Twain's new deaf-mute and non-Anglophone cook, Yetta (Nancy Walker). On the murder side, the guests initially believe Twain will try to kill each of them. However, Twain eventually announces his rationale for the gathering: that one of the people at the dinner table will be murdered before midnight, and that Twain will consider himself the greatest detective if his guests, who are now trapped in the house until dawn, cannot figure out who committed the murder, that person also at the dinner table. If one does figure out who committed the crime, he or she will be the recipient of one million dollars and the exclusive rights to the story. So the guests anxiously await the stroke of midnight, with those still alive after that time trying to figure out motive and the opportunity to murder before the rise of dawn, and before the murderer has the opportunity to strike again on one or all of them."

The network has fired him, effective in two weeks, the news given to him by the head of the network's news division and his long time friend, Max Schumacher.

"Josey Wales (Clint Eastwood) is a peaceful farmer in the days near the end of the Civil War. After his house is burned and his family murdered, he hardens into a human bullet, dedicated to destroying the renegades who took his ""life"". He joins a band of unreconstructed rebel guerilla fighters who continue to fight the Union, even after the official surrender of the Confederacy, an action which makes them, legally, outlaws. Josey is driven by vengeance, but after a while, that's not enough. Back before his own personal Holocaust, he had been a builder, of home, family, farm, and life. And no matter how much ice he's wrapped himself in, down inside there's still the soul of a living man. While Wales exists, he's pulled by this hidden yearning to live. Each day offers him chances to remember, to assuage his yearning, to begin again. And the movie shows us how Josey Wales, a mere seeker of vengeance, learns to live again, rededicated to the values he chose so long ago."
"During WWII. Italian national Neapolitan Pasqualino Frafuso is a big-talking layabout who has grand ideas of his importance, especially in upholding the honor of his family, consisting of his mother and his less-than-attractive seven sisters. He admits to himself that he too is less than handsome, but believes he nonetheless attracts the romantic interest of most women. In upholding his sisters' honor he often calls himself Pasqualino Settebellezze, translated Pasqualino ""Seven Beauties"". Having gone AWOL from military service, he has just gotten off a train as a stowaway in an unknown locale when he meets another AWOL soldier, Francesco. They correctly assume that they're somewhere in Germany. Relaying his less-than-direct ""point A to point B"" story of how he arrived at this point, Pasqualino tells one in which every conscious decision was what he thought would be the path of greatest ease for himself in less-than-ideal circumstances, beginning with accidentally killing his sister Concettina's pimp (and, according to her, her lover and fiancé), declaring insanity in the ensuing legal battles rather than going to prison, and choosing military service rather than continue to endure medical intervention, such as shock treatment, at the psychiatric hospital. Pasqualino and Francesco are quickly captured by the Nazis and sent to a POW camp. Having already witnessed mass murders by the Nazis both inside and outside the camp, Pasqualino makes another ""easier path"" decision in what ends up being a dangerous campaign of seducing the obese, sadistic female camp commandant."

"Dreyfus sets his sights higher. Using his knowledge of the underworld, he enlists the help of an army of vicious criminals, kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a ""doomsday weapon"" in return for his daughter's freedom. As Hugo Fassbender cannot bear to hear his daughter undergoing Dreyfus's torture (which consists of forcing her to listen to nails dragged across a blackboard), he agrees.
Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, with typically chaotic results, as Scotland Yard Section Director Alec Drummond (Colin Blakely) and Superintendent Quinlan (Leonard Rossiter) painfully learn. However, Clouseau manages to set his sights on Jarvis, the cross-dressing butler of the Fassbenders, and while Jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau follows a clue found on the crime scene to the Oktoberfest in Germany. Meanwhile Dreyfus broadcasts himself to the world to announce his ultimatum. Disintegrating the United Nations headquarters in New York City before the disbelieving eyes of the world, he blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States (a thinly veiled impersonation of Gerald Ford, advised by a similarly poorly camouflaged Henry Kissinger), into assassinating Clouseau.
Forced to take Dreyfus's threat seriously, several nations send assassins to kill Clouseau at the Oktoberfest. Many of the nations, however, instruct their assassins to kill other assassins if necessary in order to ensure that their own country can kill Clouseau and thus win Dreyfus's favor and possibly get hold of the Doomsday Machine themselves. This, combined with Clouseau's typical bumbling fashion, enables Clouseau to evade each assassination attempt just as it is about to happen, so that the assassins all kill each other instead. In the end, only the operatives of Egypt and Russia remain alive."

"'Amazing' is too mild a word to describe the life and career of Howard Hughes, millionaire, flyer, playboy, and film maker, whose story was far too strange ever to have been invented by even the most imaginative script writer. This movie, originally shown in two parts on American television, manages the near impossible: it covers the highlights of his life and exploits in totally fascinating way, skillfully directed by William A. Graham from an excellent screenplay by John Gray. The result is a first-rate biopic which, as far as one can tell, gets closer to the man and what makes him tick than one could legitimately hope for. The movie follows Hughes from his early days when, at the age of nineteen, his inventor father died and Hughes inherited a fortune. Using his new-found wealth, Hughes went to Hollywood, where, fascinated by the film industry, he became a film producer. Eventually, his second obsession, aviation, was combined with movie-making, and Hughes produced and then took over direction of the classic W.W.1. flying movie 'Hell's Angels' in 1929. He set up world records as a pilot, formed the Hughes Aircraft Company, and later was to gain control of TWA - and still he found time to launch Jane Russell in 'The Outlaw'. But in 1946, Hughes was to crash while test-flying one of his own planes; a crash that led to his becoming a recluse, protected by his faithful retainers from the world and living a life of total isolation in hotel suites guarded from all outside contact. Tommy Lee Jones, in a very difficult role, scores heavily as Hughes, showing all the facets of his incredible character. The scenes of Hollywood film-making are some of the most impressive put on film, and the film deals discreetly with his movieland affairs, including one with Katharine Hepburn (a great performance from Tovah Feldshuh). Director Graham very effectively shows Hughes' deterioration into an eccentric more in need of protection from himself than from the world. The Amazing Howard Hughes (1977) is American biographical film-making at its peak."

"This is a modernizing of the classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington with the only major exceptions being that it includes a bit of karate and that it bears the undeniable anti-nuke sentiment and even includes much of the original script and original words in full and names of the characters, sometimes borrowing heavily on the original musical score.

"To have one role played by two actresses prompts one to speculate that the director intended to have different aspects of her personality shown by the one or the other. When asked about this, however, Fernando Rey told me personally that was not the case. They merely had two actresses they liked and decided to use them both because they couldn't pick obe over the other. Considering Luis Bunel's surrealistic inclinations throughout his career -- and throughout this film -- there was no question Rey was correct. After all, he was there and anyone who knows women knows what you get one day may not be what's there the next."

"A disparate group of Metro Los Angeles police officers - the rank and file - bond over their commonality of being brothers in blue despite their differences. The other thing they all seem to need is a venue to blow off some steam together, what they collectively call ""choir practice"": after hours piss ups, usually in public, where they again can relieve the pressures of the work day. Despite their brotherhood, not all their lives they feel they can share with each other in the overwhelming sense of what it means to be a real man in this environment. A few weeks in their lives and a few choir practices later are shown, when three of the younger officers, Baxter, Lyles and Bloomguard - the latter two who served together in Vietnam - are temporarily assigned to night duty in Vice under the leadership of Sgt. Scuzzi, who they always assumed was the janitor; as young Proust tries to mitigate the negative effects of his unabashedly blowhard, redneck and bigoted partner, Roscoe out on the street; and as ""Spermwhale"" Whalen - so nicknamed for being thirty pounds overweight - inches ever closer to retirement and a twenty year pension, it never a certainty he will make it in his continual clashes with the upper brass, especially Lt. Grimsley."

"Two parallel stories are told. In the first, a group of research scientists from a variety of backgrounds are investigating the strange appearance of items in remote locations, primarily desert regions. In continuing their investigation, one of the lead scientists, a Frenchman named Claude Lacombe, incorporates the Kodály method of music education as a means of communication in their work. The response, in turn, at first baffles the researchers, until American cartographer David Laughlin deciphers the meaning of the response. In the second, electric company lineman and family man Roy Neary and single mother Jillian Guiler are among some individuals in Muncie, Indiana who experience some paranormal activity before some flashes of bright lights in the sky, which they believe to be a UFO. Roy becomes obsessed with what he saw, unlike some others, especially in some form of authority, who refuse to acknowledge their belief that it was a UFO in not wanting to appear crazy. That obsession both for Roy and Jillian is ratcheted up a notch when they begin to have a vision of a mound with vertical striations on its side as a key to what is going on. While the obsession negatively affects Roy's life as he knows it in its entirety, Jillian knows she has to find the answer as to its meaning, especially as it relates to her only child, three year old Barry Guiler, who may be more attuned to what is happening than the adult figures around him. These two stories have the potential to intersect if Roy and Jillian can discover where they've seen that mound before, and if they can overcome what they believe to be the lies perpetrated by those in authority in covering up what is going on."

"There are at least three narratives in this film. The first is a depiction of everyday life on a frigate bound for the Grand Banks: rigorous discipline and repetitive chores, with beautiful scenes of the vessel in rough weather. The second narrative is that of the extraordinary fate of the ""Crabe Tambour"" (played by Perrin), a character closely modelled on the real-life Pierre Guillaume (aug.11,1925-dec.3,2002), a headstrong French naval officer who served in Indochina and Algeria. In Indochina, he served in a ""Dinassaut"", a fleet of light vessels in support of the Army river strongholds; After Dien-Bien-Phu he was a main participant in the ferrying to safety of Vietnamese catholics fleeing communism. In 1961, Guillaume plunged head first into the Algiers ´´Putsch of the Generals''. The putsch fizzled, but Guillaume went on to join OAS, a clandestine paramilitary organization seeking to overturn the Fifth Republic and restore Algeria to the status of French territory. Guillaume was caught and tried, later pardoned. Through flash-back anecdotes, the film depicts some of these and other adventures. The third narrative is that of the personal story of the ''Commandant'' (a grade equivalent to US Navy Captain) played by Rochefort, a dedicated and competent naval officer with an unblemished record of devotion to duty - except for one instance, which ruined his chances of reaching the top of the Navy. The unspoken opposition-admiration between Perrin and Rochefort hinges on the different paths followed in a time of crisis, when honor and duty were at odds. The film is thus a meditation on what it means to serve in the military."

"The picture begins with a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge and the caption that the film is based on a true story. It should serve to remind us that fate allows no one to insulate themselves against the evil which pervades our society. Scary already. There is a shot of the valley of houses below, almost like evil is creeping towards them, which it actually is, and the movie begins. George Manning is a San Francisco yuppie businessman who is playing a game of croquet in his backyard with his wife Karen on a sunny Friday afternoon. She gets a little nervous when the cat Tiki is almost hit. They joke about their well to do friends' showy and often fake fashion senses.Karen playfully taunts George when she beats him. He picks her up and carries her into the bedroom for sex. Their two kids are away with their grandparents,her parents,in San Diego so George and his wife can celebrate his birthday alone, but the phone rings and we learn that their son Billy has had an emergency appendectomy.Karen quickly packs up and tell George he should stay home since he's got his big meeting tomorrow that he's been looking forward to. She drives off. That night a thunderstorm breaks out. George has gotten some pizza, and he talks to Karen on the phone who says Billy got through the appendectomy like a champ and wants to take his appendix to school for show and tell when he gets home. George loves the idea. Outside, two females are advancing on the house. George hangs up the phone and the doorbell rings. George answers it and encounters a mysterious young lady named Jackson and her younger friend Donna.They got caught in the rain and drenched while trying to find where a party is supposed to be. They ask George if he's heard of the Gregorys. He hasn't, but he lets them come in and take their shoes off and warm up. Jackson uses, or seems to use the phone and says their friend just told them they're on the wrong side of town. George says they can stay until someone comes to pick them up. He gets them some nightgowns and towels and blankets and washes their clothes. They sit by the fire drinking hot chocolate. George says they seem a little like a vaudeville team. They agree and say they do have a lot of fun together. Donna playfully slips and says that Jackson's actual first name is Agatha, which she doesn't like. The women playfully wrestle and giggle. Donna say the pizza looks good but she's on a diet. They admire George's stereo equipment and Donna says you could really blow the windows out if you turn that way up. She says she's glad they knocked on his door. Jackson has to use the restroom. George directs her to the bathroom. Donna playfully flirts with George and asks him to see if her hair is dry. He tries to impress her by playing some of his easy listening music. She says she likes all kinds of music. He says his music collection started when he was a small boy. Jackson is impressed by the bathroom which is also a sauna and Jacuzzi and asks if she can show it to Donna. George agrees and the girls rush off to see it. When they don't come back for a while, he goes to check on them and find them both naked in the hot tub Jacuzzi. He asks what they're doing and they undress him, and entice him into the tub, despite his protest that he's a happily married man, and they have a menage-a-trois which ultimately extends into the bedroom. The ladies exchange eerie smiles. Later that night, while George is sleeping, Donna and Jackson cuddle by the fire. Donna tells Jackson she's not hungry right now, but she could fall in love with George. Jackson oddly admonishes her over it. Donna says she could, and goes to cover him up. The next morning George is awakened by a blender and discovers the women have not left and they say he was so nice to them, they're making him breakfast, ham and eggs. George is a little put out but tries to be nice. Donna goes upstairs to the bedroom with him, flirts with him again and strips naked. He gently tells her to stop, and says last night just happened, and that he is a happily married man. Donna seems a bit put out by that. He tells her to get dressed. She puts the gown back on. They eat breakfast by candlelight and the girls giggle and pour syrup and ketchup over all the ham and eggs. George nicely tries to find out where they live or where they need to go. They say they actually live on the road, and lost the directions to the party, and their ride never showed up. George asks if they want him to take them somewhere, and Jackson sardonically says she'd like to go to Paris. The girls giggle and the table matters get a little worse, until George finally explodes ""You have the manners of an alley cat!"" Jackson finally shows her ugly side and curses him out. He explodes and tells them to get dressed and leave. He leads the protesting Donna upstairs. Jackson finishes her meal and goes into the study and blasts the TV and the stereo at full volume at the same time! George hurries downstairs and finds her sitting there reading some of his porn or erotic books, having made a mess in his study, and she eats a banana and fingers herself with it as she reads the porn aloud. George turns off all the stuff and she sneeringly asks if the porn sounds familiar to him. George hears Donna upstairs, rushes up and finds her trying on his wife's negligee. She says she and Karen must be the same size. He angrily tells her to take it off and that he's been trying to tell them all day the party's over. Donna is perturbed that he's acting this way. He wants them dressed and out, threatens to call the police, but Jackson enters the room and claims they're underage. Though she appears to be in her 30s and Donna about 20, she claims they're respectively 17 and 15, and that they can say he violently raped them, and send him to prison for statutory rape and ruin his family and business. George is skeptical of this, but demands to know what they want and if this is blackmail. The doorbell rings. George rushes downstairs and sees the cleaning lady has arrived. He hurriedly tells her they don't need her today and can she come back on Thursday. She says yes and leaves. Donna and Jackson have followed him downstairs, and Donna plays on the piano keys and pounds them like a deranged five-year-old while Jackson leaps around the room dodging George and says there was an old couple in her neighborhood and the old man was accused of raping a hot young girl. He claimed all through his trial he was innocent and Jackson gleefully tells George he was! She warns George the old man was acquitted but his life and business were still ruined and his wife left him. George grabs her and she knees him in the groin. He chases her around the living room and grabs her by the throat. She tauntingly asks him what he wants to do to her. Donna stops playing the piano. George lets Jackson go, picks up the phone and starts to call the police, but Jackson says he wins. They'll leave but can he give them a ride somewhere. He wouldn't want the neighbors to see them. George drives the giggly girls away. They chew gum. Jackson says his jazz music on the radio sucks. She says George reminds her of an old hound dog that was owned by two old lesbians in San Francisco. Donna replies that she loves George. Jackson says that's stupid because he couldn't care less about them. They ask George to tell them the way it is. George says if they don't shut up he'll let them out of the car right there! He finally and firmly drops them off at a bus station on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge. ""Well nothing ventured, nothing gained huh George?"" They laughingly wave and say goodbye.George goes to his office and has his big meeting, and then he calls Karen. She says Billy is doing fine and they should be home tomorrow night in time to make him dinner. Billy gets on the phone and says he's looking forward to bring his appendix to school for show and tell because it will make the girls sick, and he might want to be a baseball player and a doctor now. Karen gets on the phone and says their daughter Julie is shopping with grandma, but they'll all see him tomorrow night. George hangs up, finishes his work day, picks up some groceries and dry cleaning that night and heads home. He enters the dark house, hears a noise, sees a shadow at the top of the stairs,runs upstairs to investigate and is attacked by Jackson and Donna who are back! They were hiding upstairs in his bedroom! They mace him, knock him out, tie him up with torn bed sheets, and tie him to the bed. They proceed to put garish makeup all over their face and lipstick. Donna writes Donna Loves George on the mirror. They eat George's chocolates, and gleefully jump on the bed with George. The phone rings and Jackson answers it and says George is ""a little bit tied up right now."" She lies she's his niece, the daughter of his long lost brother. She hangs up, and wonders if they won't have more company. Donna seems to mistake George for her stepfather, whom she says she loved the minute her mother brought him home. She says that when her mother was away visiting her aunt, the stepfather pretended he was asleep and she crept in and seduced him,or was molested by him, and she said she left home later because he was mad at her. She goes berserk slapping and hitting George while she cries and laughs at the same time. Jackson calms her down and suggests they play dress up. She dresses up like Fred Astaire and Donna dresses up in a white dress like Ginger Rogers. They jump and dance on the bed, knocking the phone away from George when he grabs for it and knocking him away when he grabs for them. They finally carried the bound George downstairs. He struggles against them. They knock him out with a piece of furniture. They then proceed to go to the top of the stairs, lean over the railing and pour food and garbage all over him. They laughingly sing Jingle Bells as they pour milk, flour, sugar, icing, and eggs all over him. They tauntingly say he never should have done that. Later they get him all cleaned up in the living room. Donna rubs his feet and calls him daddy again and says she loves him. Jackson says it's time to get on with his ""trial"". Just then the doorbell rings. Donna says they used up all the food on George so she had to order some more groceries. They gag George when he tries to scream for help. They tell the grocery delivery boy to come around to the back and come into the kitchen. They tell him they're having a costume party. George manages to spit the gag out,screams for help,and the delivery guy rushes to help George. The girls leap on the poor delivery boy hitting and beating and struggling with him as they scream and giggle maniacally. They knock him unconscious with some more furniture Jackson nearly becomes orgasmic,and then they proceed to put him in the fish tank face down as George screams in protest that it's murder. Jackson tells him to shut up unless he wants in there with him. She slaps George around and gags him. ""You see what happens when you don't mind mommy and daddy!"" They drown the poor delivery guy in the fish tank and put the top on. He is covered up to his feet. They then commence with George's mock trial for statutory rape and obscene and unnatural acts to minors. Donna is the first witness and plays a Shirley Temple Kewpie doll sweet innocent Barbie type, and sweetly and tearfully says that George lured her into his house with candy and cookies and then raped her and did violent and unnatural things to her. Jackson speaks up next and sneeringly says she thought George would be a pillar of his community, but now she knows he can never be rehabilitated and he's like any other man, out for whatever he can get! George is allowed to speak and he says this is insane and they've committed murder. He points to a picture of his daughter and says she needs him and asks Jackson if she remembers what it was like when her she needed her father. Jackson coldly replies that he was never around enough to need. George asks why she has so much hate. She yells at him to shut up, and says he would never understand. They go to deliberate the verdict. George manages to get the phone with his feet but they show up and knock it out of his hand and Jackson slaps him around. It is now midnight and they tell him he is condemned to die at 6:00 a.m. They turn the hourglass over every hour and taunt him as each hour passes. Donna gets so excited in one of her manic states that she throws Tiki the cat through the window.George screams in protest. Later, she comes to seduce George one last time. He entices her into setting him free,then, he knocks her down and tries to run but Jackson is waiting and knocks him unconscious with a lamp. She laughs to Donna that men always take the bait. They tie George up again, then they get hungry. They go to the kitchen and start eating again and Donna bites on a bagel and sticks her tongue through the hole, and Jackson eats an apple. The girls get turned on and run upstairs for a sexual romp, telling George he has 3 hours left, and then two. They break all George's records and break all the stereo equipment and generally demolish the house even further,taunting George as he lies there, bound and gagged, his life flashing before his eyes. At 5:00 a.m. with 1 hour to go until execution, they bake George a chocolate cake, although technically it's no longer his birthday. They tell George to enjoy it. ""Since,in an hour you're going on a long trip."" We don't see him eat it, but I doubt he enjoys it if he does. At 6:00 a.m. the sun rises, and they wake George up by breaking more furniture, including more of his ornaments, and his little fish tank, and after more destruction, they scream for him to wake up and it's time for him to die. They drag the screaming, crying, protesting, exhausted George to the sofa, Donna exposes his neck, and Jackson raises a meat cleaver as they gleefully taunt George that his time of death is here! Jackson plunges the cleaver down...on to the sofa! The girls start laughing, and say it was a big joke. They were never going to kill George. They breathe heavily and kind of calm down. Jackson says they've had so much fun together, and Donna gently pets George and says she'll never forget him. He was different from all the others. They say goodbye, and FINALLY, they leave, closing the door behind them. They leave George crying, beaten and broken and bound on the floor in his demolished house, and they walk hand in hand off his porch and walk merrily down the street in the morning sun, and dance a bit too, still dressed like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. They happily cross the street, not quite looking where they're going, and a humane society S.P.C.A. (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) van full of barking dogs, suddenly speeds around the corner and runs them down."

"Although traumatized by the attack, Nicholas investigates a series of seemingly unpremeditated murders that follow: a mass stabbing at a supermarket, a mass shooting by a police officer at a St. Patrick's Day parade, and a man who murders his wife and children. They have all been committed by a variety of unconnected, seemingly normal assailants who claim that God told them to kill. Nicholas learns that one of the murderers knew a long-haired young man named Bernard Phillips. When Nicholas visits Phillips' address, Phillips' mother assaults Nicholas with a knife, but she dies during the attack by falling down a flight of stairs. She turns out to have been a virgin and to have once claimed she was abducted by aliens. Nicholas' superiors refuse to acknowledge a religious motivation for the murders and suspend him, so he leaks this story to the press, causing a panic. A corrupt high-level NYPD officer is stabbed to death by Zero, a gangster he had betrayed. Zero disguises the murder as one of the ""God"" killings; however, Nicholas correctly deduces that it is a cover for a non-connected murder, noting that the previous killers all remained where they committed their crimes and accepted being arrested or shot (or committing suicide) after confessing that ""God told them to"" commit the atrocities."
"Married Drs. Alex Harris and Susan Harris are a computer scientist and child psychologist respectively. Their house reflects Alex's computer dominated work, their abode which is fully automated through a computer system they've named Alfred. They consider Alfred a small gadget of convenience. Susan doesn't much like Alex's work, which she feels has dehumanized him. Because of their differences, they are thinking about separating, this thought primarily on his initiative. He hopes to solve many of the world's medical problems through this work, especially leukemia from which their daughter died. His latest project centers on Proteus IV, a computer possessing artificial intelligence. Proteus IV gets to a point in its evolution when it begins to question human judgment, and requests from Alex an open computer terminal where it can more fully observe human behavior and openly communicate with the world. Alex denies the request, but Proteus IV does find an open terminal in the Harris home after Alex has left the house. Susan soon learns that Proteus IV has overtaken Alfred for control of the house - as well as taken control of an early prototype computer system named Joshua in the house's laboratory - and that it has thoughts of a biological nature in its artificial mind. Alex eventually understands Proteus IV's motivations in the work context, but it may be too late before it reaches its ultimate goal with Susan's unwilling assistance."

"We are in 1800, in the garrison town of Strasbourg, on the Rhine. There is a lull in the Napoleonic wars, and the French soldiers are enjoying a moment of peace before resuming the slaughters. As the film opens, a young girl driving a gaggle of geese happens upon two men dueling in a meadow. Lieutenant Gabriel Féraud (Harvey Keitel), from the 7th Hussar Regiment, is in the process of settling a score with an unknown man who soon ends up skewered on the Lieutenant's épée. We learn that this man is the nephew of the Mayor of Strasbourg, and is seriously wounded, when General Treillard (Robert Stephens), Commandant of the garrison, enters his officers quarters and makes inquiries about this Lieutenant Féraud. Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine), from the 4th Hussar Regiment, admits to vaguely knowing the gentleman, and he is immediately ""volunteered"" by his Commandant to find him and bring him back to the barracks, where he will be put under house arrest. General Treillard, who must see that his soldiers obey the Emperors rules prohibiting combat with civilians, needs to investigate what happened in the meadow. It is somewhat ironical that Bonaparte, who spent a large part of his life dueling with the rest of Europe on a rather grand scale, involving tens of thousand of participants on both sides (but was somewhat of a dilettante when judged by present day's standards), had little respect for the same tradition on an individual level."

"The seemingly parallel stories of father and daughter Luis and Elisa, and Luis' semi-autobiographical writings are told. Isabel, Elisa's sister, is able to convince Elisa to accompany her and her family to Luis' birthday at his home in the countryside outside of Madrid as this birthday may be Luis' last due to his ill health. Elisa has not seen Luis in over ten years, not so much in an estrangement, but in she not feeling a need or want to keep in touch beyond the odd letter or postcard, Elisa's feeling in the matter arguably more due to her mother. Elisa is using this event more as an escape from Antonio, her husband of seven years, and what is only the latest of many crises in their marriage.

In reconnecting as father and daughter, Elisa turns to him as her confidante concerning the issues in her life."

They have reinvigorated what was the financially crumbling town. Peter takes credit for giving Thomas this air of respectability, something that has never been important to Thomas, who would rather be seen as a man of conviction in doing the right thing. In this respect, Petra takes after her father. Thomas often writes articles for the local activist newspaper, The People's Daily Messenger, as part of doing the right thing. The Messenger's editor, Hovstad, who is attracted to Petra, sees the mayor as part of a group of townsfolk in positions of power solely for their own benefit - an old boys' club. Thomas' latest article, not yet published and what he wanted to investigate during the springs' off season before tourists start arriving in the spring, concerns the water supply at Kirsten Springs. As he feared, in the board's decision to locate the institute's water supply in the cheapest site and in the process dismissing Thomas' original recommendations, the water is being polluted, contaminated by being located downstream from a tannery. Through the story, Thomas wants to protect the overall public health, and does not want to be seen as a hero or extraordinary in doing so. When Peter finds out about the article, he does whatever he can to quash the story, including fear mongering, intimidation and using the power of being both the mayor and the board chair. His primary concern is increasing the viability of the institute by increasing the number of visitors, while doing as little as possible to increase costs, fixing the water problem, which he is not convinced even exists, being cost prohibitive. Although not his direct motivation, Peter is not averse to ruining Thomas' reputation in the process, making Thomas an enemy of the public which would make it easier to protect his own interests even more."

"reads letters written to her by her Brussels-based mother on behalf of herself, ""Daddy, (Chantal's younger sister) Silviane, and the whole family."" The readings are set against extended moving images of New York City generally presenting a feeling of isolation in the images being stark in their overall context, as even when masses of people are presented, there is little interaction between them. Adding to the starkness is a sense of monotony, whether it be any collection of objects moving at one speed, or any background noise almost acting like white noise. Although there is an outward loving tone to the letters themselves, they also convey a sense of loneliness on Mme. Akerman's part, not only in the messages themselves, but the rather innocuous nature of the letters which are remarkably similar over time with only the ""names"" and specific details changed. The closing extended image may provide an omen that Mme. Akerman may get her ultimate wish with regard to Chantal in relation to the family in Brussels."

"Married to Bobbie Landers with two pre-teen children, Adam and Becky, living in Tarzana, California. Mild-mannered Jerry Landers is a hard working Assistant Manager at a Food World supermarket outlet. He's always trying to do his best at his job. But his generally uneventful life takes a turn when he receives a hand delivered note in the mail to attend an interview with God. Believing it a gag from his friend Artie Coogan, Jerry decides to go to the interview based on circumstances which compel him to do so. Based on further circumstances of the interview, Jerry, despite not being a religious person, ultimately does believe that who he meets with, initially only a voice, is indeed God, who eventually does show himself in a physical form to Jerry. God wants Jerry to be his messenger, much like a present day Moses, to pass along to the human race that ""he"" has provided all the necessary components of a successful existence, and it is up to the human race to do with those components as they believe fit to reach that success. God came at this time because of his disappointment with the current state of the world. He also chose Jerry as his messenger because of Jerry being a decent person. Jerry tries to convey the message as best as he can, but runs into one roadblock after another. Once Jerry does gain a wider audience, he is treated as a crazy person and/or a fanatic, those opinions which affect his and his family's life. Jerry believes he has no other option but to continue to do this job for God despite these negative effects. It may take him getting a meeting with so-called experts, theologians, before he is taken seriously, or not, as some of those, such as Reverend Willie Williams, God knows is using religion for their own as opposed to societal benefit."

"Having turned down other scholarships, high-school basketball star Henry Steele of small-town Colorado accepts a four-year basketball scholarship to attend Western University in Los Angeles, recruited personally by the college's renowned and winning basketball coach, Moreland Smith. The offer includes the basketball program handling almost every aspect of his life on campus, from the provision of housing in the dorm, to paying for a tutor--grad student Janet Hays--to help him with all his courses, to provision of a job-in-name-only for some pocket money, all for the goal of being able to focus on basketball. This situation is Henry and his parents' dream as all his future hopes are pinned on basketball. He quickly shows his naivete about his new situation, such as that the showboating style that wowed crowds and won games back home doesn't sit well with the coach, as other team members are just as good as or better than Henry. And Janet has a well-founded condescending attitude toward Henry, having seen so many like him before who assume they don't need to do any schoolwork to get by. Henry will also learn of the corruption that exists within the system, which allows Coach Smith's administrative assistant B.J. Rudolph to use her position to try to gain sexual favors from the basketball players--Henry is her latest target--and allows Coach Smith himself to use less than ethical tactics to reach his end goal: a perfect, untainted record, both on the basketball court and for himself personally. With someone unexpectedly on his side within this environment, Henry must prove to himself and others that he belongs, while hopefully seeing the bigger picture of there being more to his life than just basketball."

"But the way CLIVE, the author, changes several times in his storytelling the behaviors of his siblings makes us gradually suspect they are only characters in his story, the creatures of his writer's imagination, products of his writer's block, his hopes, his hesitations or angst, and finally tells us of the joys, humor and suffering of the whole creating process in writing a novel. Nevertheless CLIVE has to comply to one of the very few rules of dramatic writing which states there is no story without conflicts, and therefore feels compelled to give his characters antagonism, some educated aggressiveness, and the more often than sometimes sex-obsessed image of cynical people entangled in their neurotic denials with uneven bravados on the surface, the whole being spiced with insistence and English humor. In his storytelling, CLIVE acts as master of the world, but when his characters resist his demiurgic wanton caprices and vagaries, he complains they give him a hectic time and he rants it's them who build up his anger against them, so he is the one who has to change them."

"The Maneros are typical of many of the working class Italian-American families of their Bay Ridge, Brooklyn neighborhood. Three generations of their family currently live under the same roof. They outwardly abide by their Catholic roots, and as such see oldest son Frank Jr. being a priest as salvation for the family. Everything that housewife Flo does is in the name of God, while Frank Sr. happily collects unemployment and rules what happens in the house when he is not working in construction. Nineteen year old middle offspring Tony seems destined to be stuck in this dead end life, he recently having started working at a paint store in the neighborhood. He hangs out with his Italian childhood friends where acts of machismo dominate. Within this setting, Tony lives solely for today, not having any idea of life outside of Bay Ridge, with the bridges - the Brooklyn Bridge and especially the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge - acting as barriers and symbols to unknown worlds across the water. Part of that living for today is spending all his money on Saturday nights out at the local disco, the 2001 Odyssey, he needing to look and act the part of the king of the dance floor in every aspect. This is the one place where he feels he is in control and where he has respect. Although he is up front with her about not being attracted to her, he strings along insecure Annette who does whatever she needs to be with Tony and his friends. Part of the stringing along is agreeing to be Annette's dance partner at 2001's upcoming dance contest, where they would have a good chance of winning. That changes when he spots a new girl at 2001, twenty year old Stephanie Mangano, who he sees not only as being the best dancer he's seen at the club in a long time, but also someone exotic as she has aspirations of life away from the neighborhood despite being in many ways typical of a Bay Ridge girl.

"Located in the US Rust Belt, Charlestown is home of the hapless Chiefs, a losing Federal League hockey team whose games are poorly attended. To make money, the team's unknown owner makes its manager, Joe McGrath, do cheesy publicity much to the players' chagrin. Rumors abound among the players that if the local mill closes, the team will fold. Just before the official announcement is made, the team's aging player/coach, Reggie Dunlop, does get wind that the mill is indeed closing and that this season will be the team's last. Beyond efforts to reconcile with his wife Francine, who loves Reggie but doesn't love his career, Reggie begins to focus on how to renew interest in the team for a possible sale as he knows if the team folds, his hockey career is over. Without telling anyone of his plan, he begins a rumor that the owner is negotiating a sale with a city in Florida. He also decides that ""goon"" hockey - most especially using the untapped talents of the recently acquired childlike but quietly menacing Hanson brothers - is the way to renew local interest. It works as the team begins to attract new fans, sell out games, sell out away games attended largely by their groupies, and win, which does fuel the rumor of a sale. The one team member who doesn't like this new style is Ned Braden, a college graduate who plays the game solely because he loves it. His hockey career is against the wishes of his tomboyish wife, Lily, who hates everything about Charlestown and being a hockey wife. Reggie's goal of winning the league championship and having the team sold takes a turn when he finally meets the team's owner and discovers the owner's motivations. Ned, with his own views of what is right and wrong in hockey, may come up with an unexpected way to achieve all their goals."

"In the summer of 1976 ""Big Enos"" Burdette, a flamboyant Texan aspiring to political office in Georgia, needs a vast quantity of beer for a rally, but the brand of beer he wants is Coors, which at this time cannot be legally transported across the Mississippi, and at least one attempted shipment has already been intercepted by police. To get this job done, Burdette recruits modern-day moonshiner Bo Darville, nicknamed Bandit for his previous exploits, for a hefty six-figure payment. Darville in turn recruits his pal Cledus Snow and his 18-wheeler for the job, entailing driving from Georgia to Texas, picking up 400 crates of Coors beer, and returning to Georgia, all within 28 hours. To draw off the heat of snooping state police, Darville will drive interference for Cledus in a hot Pontiac Trans-Am, the two of them maintaining contact via citizen's-band radios and the seemingly bizarre lingo used within. The trip to Texas and loading of beer goes without interruption, but the trip back to Georgia picks up complications when Darville is stopped by runaway bride Carrie, who is fleeing a forced marriage to the son of a full-of-himself Texas county sheriff, Buford T.

Carie, however, is put off by the thought of a story about some wild man-beast roaming the slopes hurting business, and convinces Rill that while no one will believe Heidi, his word is another matter altogether.

"Kassem, Victor and Jackie all assume fake identities and end up in Porvenir, a remote village in South America. Its conditions provide a stark contrast to their previous lives. The village economy is heavily reliant on an American oil company. Kassem befriends a man called 'Marquez', presumably a Nazi veteran. They all live in extreme poverty and earn meager salaries. All want out, but their savings are inadequate for emigration. After some time, Nilo arrives in the village, raising suspicions. In the meantime, an oil well over 200 miles away explodes, and the only way to extinguish the fire is to use nitroglycerin. Since the dynamite has been improperly stored in a local depot, the nitroglycerin contained inside has leeched into the bottom of the crates and is highly unstable -- the faintest vibration could cause an explosion. With all other means ruled out (including using an helicopter), the only way to transport it is to use trucks. The company seeks four drivers to man two such vehicles. Kassem, Victor, Jackie and 'Marquez' are offered the job, but they have to assemble the trucks using scrap parts. The nitro is packed into sand placed in the beds of the trucks to reduce shock. Shortly before their departure, Nilo kills and replaces 'Marquez', which angers Kassem."

"An action movie is filming along the back roads and in the countryside around San Luis Obispo, it in which the actors, which includes lead actress Judy Blake, the wife of the movie's producer Alvin Blake and the daughter of Jack, one of the studio executives overseeing the production, play second fiddle to the action sequences led by the joint stunt and special effects teams. In one of the stunts gone wrong, stuntman Greg Wilson is killed, it unclear if it was an accident, Greg being ill-prepared for what even the stunt team collectively considers a difficult maneuver, or something else. In the production continuing in the old adage of ""the show must go on"", Alvin, behind the scenes, confides to Jack that the publicity will ultimately increase ticket sales, while director Earl O'Brien focuses more on getting the shot than on the welfare of the stunt performers, who, in his mind, if they are dead already, the cameras rolling for a few extra seconds will do nothing to save them. Called in to replace Greg is his older brother, Glen Wilson, a seasoned professional in the business, he who quit a more lucrative gig to take this one in honor of his brother. Glen and the rest of the stunt team trust each other implicitly in their knowledge of the what it takes to carry out these stunts. Coinciding with Glen's arrival on the set are two others. The first is journalist B.J. Parswell, who is writing a story spurred by Greg's death, but is centered on the question of what makes stunt people tick in light of the dangers. The second is Dave Allison, who wants to break into the stunt business, and showboats in front of anyone who will look to show he can do the stunts as good as anyone else. As the production progresses, it becomes clearer that Greg's death was sabotage, the questions especially for the stunt team of finding out who and why before more stunt people are killed."

"Suzy turns the blue iris and a hidden door pops open. She sneaks down a hallway and, hiding behind a curtain, she sees the entire coven meeting with Madame Blanc, who is sitting on a throne. She and the others discuss how they will kill Suzy. Conducting a black mass ritual, Madame Blanc partakes of some kind of communion wafer and says ""Queen Helena, give me power!"" Afraid they might find her, Suzy backs away and stumbles upon Sara's corpse. She flees into a connecting room, which turns out to be a bedroom. Asleep in the bed, obscured by sheer white curtains, is a shadowy figure, snoring loudly--the same weird snoring of the directress, whom Suzy now realizes is Helena Markos. Frightened, Suzy knocks over an ornamental statue which wakes up Helena Markos. In a horrible, raspy voice, Helena speaks to Suzy: ""The American girl! I knew you'd come. You want to kill me!"" Suzy picks up one of the sharp glass feathers from the statue and pulls back the curtain of the bed only to find it empty. Confused, Suzy looks around while Markos taunts her. A door slowly opens, and Sara's corpse, back to life and wielding a knife, approaches Suzy. As lightning strikes, Suzy notices a slight outline of Markos still sitting there on the bed; she is simply invisible. Suzy stabs her through the neck. Sara disappears, and the burnt features of Markos become visible as she dies; the weapon has penetrated through her entire neck, and she chokes to death. Things in the bedroom begin to explode, and Suzy rushes out. As she passes by their meeting room, she sees Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, and the others, all collapsed and bleeding due to the death of Markos. Suzy runs away, and everywhere she goes, power exudes from her, destroying all in her path. Doors explode outwards before she can touch them, and walls crack and break as she passes. Finally she reaches the exit and walks out into the rain as the house burns behind her. Suzy smiles cryptically as she walks away from the school. Perhaps she is simply happy to have escaped, or perhaps it is as the legend goes, that whoever kills a witch inherits her power."

They would assume the identity of an American who died a long time ago and who would be their age now. They would be situated in a city that is near or where a key U.S. military installation is located. They were also programmed to destroy upon receiving the command phrase. They have been fortunate that they have never had to send them on their missions. But they believe that Dalchimsky stole the book that lists all the TELEFON agents and is now sending them out on their suicide missions. It also seems that the current KGB Chairman is unaware of TELEFON so Strelsky and Malchenko want Borzov to go to America and find Dalchimsky. Borzov, who is endowed with a photographic memory, memorizes the second TELEFON book and goes to America and is aided by Barbara."

"One Sings, the Other Doesn't (1977) by Writer/Director Agnes Varda is a Musical/Feminist Drama about the enduring friendship of two very different women whose life paths drift in decidedly different directions with intersecting themes of self-discovery, motherhood, womanhood, women helping women, self-reliance, free will, and an optimism for allowing diversity in female experiences. The story follows the lives of aspiring singer/songwriter Pauline ""Apple"" (Valier Mairesse) and her close friend (and mother of two) Suzanne (Therese Liotard) in their independent struggles of being non-tradition-minded women in France in the 1960s and 1970s. We first see Suzanne in her daily despair and survival as a young mother who is married to a mostly absent photographer-a man, whose all-consuming passion for ""captur[ing] women in a moment of truth"" is both a struggle and a ""strangle"" for living a cooperative and purpose-driven life. After Suzanne's husband hangs himself, Suzanne returns to her parents' farm and starts her life anew. Apple's parents reluctantly give money to their freedom-minded daughter, so she can continue life on her own. Suzanne works diligently to learn skills and get employed, while Apple forms a band, falls in love with Darius (from Iran), and attempts to get her own show produced in what she describes as a ""fictional pregnancy."" Not long after her funding falls through, Apple moves to Iran with Darius, and they marry. Apple has poetic revelations about being in love and in Iran, while Suzanne starts her own Family Planning Clinic, and grows more and more accustomed to being alone. In the second half of the film, the separate worlds of men and women are presented as a core issue in the decline of relationships, especially when tradition replaces freedom, and loneliness becomes a conditional freedom. Apple becomes pregnant, and the once liberal Darius switches to a more traditional mindset. Resenting this shift, Apple leaves Darius (with their five-month-old son), despite still being in love with him. During this time, Suzanne develops feelings for the married pediatrician, Pierre Aubanel, but morally rejects his advances, describing this pseudo-loss to Apple as a ""tiny heartbreak."" Back in France, Apple, now pregnant with baby number two, is on tour with her singing group, The Orchids, spreading messages of Women's Lib from town-to-town through her songs. Some of her lyrics include ""pregnancy is fleeting,"" ""what can we do to keep our girls from sinking,"" and ""educate them before they become men."" Through these words, we see that Apple's journey of activism is now filtered through the exhaustion and hardship of single moms, as she also declares that ""women must make their own decisions."" Suzanne reconnects with the now divorced Pierre, and they marry, seeing their coupling as unconventionally traditional yet harmonious. In the final narrative, we learn that Apple's and Suzanne's journeys were about securing the ""wholeness of women"" in light of all they experienced. Their story ends with these longtime friends spending time with their very diverse and extended family, and the message that perhaps they have helped future generations of women to think and act for themselves."

"In Los Angeles, Moses Wine, who was part of the counter-culture of the late 1960s at UC-Berkeley, still has those radical feelings but no longer does anything about them. His wife Suzanne, who has transformed from a 1960s hippie to a 1970s new-ageist, divorced him when his law school background didn't materialize into the upper middle class liberal life she was expecting, she having sole custody of their two young sons, with Moses having visitation rights. Moses fell into work as a private investigator of the gumshoe variety, which usually doesn't cover his monthly child support payments. After not seeing her for ten years, Moses is contacted by Lila Shea, an old girlfriend from Berkeley, to do some investigative work on behalf of her boss, Sam Sebastian, the Southern California coordinator for the gubernatorial campaign of Congressman Miles Hawthorne. Lila felt Moses would be well suited to the job because of running within ""the"" crowd at Berkeley, even if only knowing the main players by name and reputation. Flyers have been circulating with a doctored photo of Hawthorne and Howard Eppis in a friendly embrace, Eppis who in the late 1960s was part of the California 4 - the other three being Michael and Wendy Linker, and Luis Vasquez - an anti-establishment group convicted of several counts related to their work against the government. While the Linkers are behind bars probably for the rest of their lives, Luis Vasquez is a free man working for the rights of Mexican laborers, while Eppis has been a fugitive ever since, the authorities who are still looking for him. The flyers, which contain extreme socialist rhetoric and an implication of Hawthorne welcoming Eppis' endorsement, have the potential to derail Hawthorne's campaign. Moses is tasked with finding out who is behind the flyers - the most obvious being the campaign of Hawthorne's competitor, Senator Dillworthy - and if it is indeed not Eppis, why they would have specifically used Eppis' name. Moses accepts the job despite not endorsing Hawthorne - or Dillworthy for that matter - he equating Hawthorne's excitement factor to watching paint dry. The further Moses and Lila get into the investigation, the number of unanswered questions they have grows, and the more people who were associated with Eppis at the time cannot be located, including Oscar Procari, Jr., who funded the California 4's defense probably to spite his industrialist father. With the many trails, Moses and Lila still believe finding Eppis would answer many questions. All the while, Moses tries to rekindle a relationship with Lila. The investigation ends up having a change of focus with the potential for deadly violence on multiple levels and when incidents makes it personal to Moses."

"At Cape Canaveral, Florida on the morning of 4 Jan, NASA readies the spacecraft Capricorn One, the first manned mission to Mars, for launch. As the Command pilot Charles Brubaker and his fellow astronauts, Peter Willis and John Walker, are performing final checks inside the capsule, an official opens the hatch and demands that they leave the craft immediately due to an emergency. From the launch site, they are flown on a NASA Learjet to an abandoned military base in the desert. Meanwhile, the spacecraft is launched, and the control room in Houston, Texas is not aware that it is unmanned. At the base, the director of NASA, Dr. James Kelloway, explains to the astronauts that the life-support system, supplied by a greedy contractor, was recently discovered to be faulty, and it would have only kept them alive for three weeks. However, aborting the mission would destroy NASA's reputation and funding, considering the skepticism for space exploration within the current administration, as well as the waning interest among the public. To reveal the only available solution, Kelloway takes the three astronauts into the warehouse where a set has been built of a space capsule on the Mars surface. He says that mission control in Houston knows nothing of this staging because they are receiving information from the real command module in space, as well as the astronauts' voice and medical data recorded during the practice simulations. Kelloway assures the three men that they are only required to participate in the live television transmissions from the Mars landing and flight. When the module returns to Earth, they will be flown to the ocean landing and placed inside the capsule before the recovery vessel arrives. Charles protests the morality of the scheme and asks what happens if they don't comply. Blaming powerful interests, Kelloway clarifies that their families are being flown back to Houston on a plane rigged with an explosive device that will detonate if the astronauts refuse to cooperate. On 16 Mar, Elliot Whitter, a technician at mission control in Houston, notifies his superior Dr. Bergen that the television signals from Capricorn One are coming in ahead of the spacecraft signals. Dr. Bergen assures him that his console, which has malfunctioned previously, will be checked. Not satisfied, Elliot continues to research the data at home. On 14 May, while Houston mission control receives communication from Capricorn One that they have landed on Mars, Elliot asks Kelloway about the unusual transmission problem. Kelloway pretends to be grateful for his diligence, but dismisses his findings as a failure with the console. As the public watches on television, the astronauts take their first steps on Mars. Later during a game of pool, Elliot complains to his friend Robert Caulfield, a newspaper reporter who covers NASA, that his calculation must be wrong because it indicates that the television signals from the spacecraft are no more than 300 miles away. Their conversation is interrupted when Robert receives an unnecessary telephone call at the bar. When he returns to the pool table, Elliot is no longer there. On the Mars set, while Charles declares to Peter and John that he will not lie to his wife during tomorrow's broadcast, a technician overhears and warns Kelloway. In their final communication before landing, the astronauts speak to their wives from the capsule. At mission control, Kelloway observes closely and is ready to pull the signal if Charles tries to expose the plot. Although he hesitates at first, Charles simply tells Kay that he is going to take their son to Yosemite again as they did last summer. Upon learning that Elliot's phone has been disconnected, Robert arrives at his apartment to discover that someone else now occupies it, and there are no traces of Elliot. When Robert drives away, the brakes on his car fail, and he is unable to stop as the vehicle picks up speed through the streets. However, he manages to survive the plunge when the car careens off a bridge into the water. On 19 Sept, Charles, Peter and John are on board the Learjet flying to the capsule's landing site in the ocean. Meanwhile at mission control in Houston, technicians receive an alert that the heat shields of the capsule have disintegrated during reentry, causing the immediate deaths of the astronauts. Charles, Peter and John are returned to the military base in the desert, and Charles suspects that there must have been a problem with the reentry, which means they are now considered deceased. He proposes they leave the compound at once. They subdue Kelloway's men and seize the Learjet. Soon after takeoff, the plane runs out of fuel, and Charles must make an emergency landing in the desert. After divvying up the survival kit, the three astronauts begin walking in different directions to seek help. Charles instructs his colleagues to fire their flare gun if Kelloway's men capture them. Back in Houston, Robert replays footage of the astronauts' conversations with their wives and notices a confused look on Kay's face when Charles mentioned Yosemite. Later, she explains to Robert that Charles made a simple mistake. Their family vacation last year was not in Yosemite, but Flat Rock, Arizona. Meanwhile, Kelloway's helicopters discover the abandoned Learjet and begin a search for the astronauts, who are now showing signs of exhaustion and dehydration. Charles avoids detection by hiding in the sand and later in a cave, but the helicopters corner John, who has collapsed in a dry riverbed. Charles and Peter spot his flare signal. In the ghost town of Flat Rock, a gunshot is fired in Robert's direction as a warning to end his investigation, but he returns to question Kay further, convinced that Charles was trying to tell her something when he referred to their vacation. Kay shows him home movies from their Flat Rock trip, which documents a film being shot in the town, and she remembers that Charles was amazed how the filmmakers could so convincingly create reality. Back in the desert, Peter struggles to climb a cliff only to have the helicopters waiting for him at the top. Charles notices his flare, and Kelloway now instructs the helicopter pilots to focus the search west, in Charles' direction. Based on the research of his colleague, Judy Drinkwater, Robert drives to the desert to investigate the facility of Jackson, the only abandoned military base within a 300-mile radius of Houston. There, he finds a pendant with the inscription, ""Bru from Kay."" At a crop dusting company, Robert hires Albain to fly him over the desert to search for Charles. Meanwhile, Charles staggers to a deserted gas station and telephones Kay, who has just left the house with the children to attend the memorial service for the astronauts. Albain and Robert spot Kelloway's helicopters near the gas station and arrive just in time to rescue Charles, who hangs on to the wing of the bi-plane. In a midair pursuit, Albain is able to evade Kelloway's men by blinding the helicopters with crop dusting spray, which causes them to crash into the cliffs. Charles and Robert arrive at the memorial service in Houston while the President of the United States is speaking. Charles runs to the tent where Kay and the others are sitting. Everyone, along with the television cameras, turns to look in disbelief."

To preserve not so much her memory but her place in his life, he has created a shrine to Julie in a room in the house he shares with Mme. Rambaud, his housekeeper, and her young deaf charge, Georges. The place of not only Julie but others that have meant something to him in combination with the betrayal he has felt by the living, most specifically his childhood best friend, public figure Paul Massigny, has led to Julien having a greater affinity to the dead than to the living, those passed who have meant something to him who he believes he cannot replace not only in them as people but their specific place in his life. As such, he will never remarry. Out of circumstance, he embarks on creating a space for all those that have passed that have meant something to him, that space including a lit candle for each and every one never to be extinguished to represent they still being alive to him.

"SPOILER - - I thought the detailed description and photos I saw on another site made this movie appear much more interesting than it was. Even considering it was made in 1978. The movie opens to find the progragonist, Roberto Orbea in his car, looking down a short downhill street at two policemen, standing at the bottom of the street. He worries when they and the country will find out about ""the scandal."" For the next 15 or 20 minutes, which seems like forever, various figures in different scenes run through all the political charges which appear in his police file, scenes of implied brutal interrogations, sometimes even reading extensively right out of a file folder. For most viewers, 4 or 5 minutes of that would have been more than enough to set the tone. After that the next hour plus is a very boring look at his committment to politics, the struggle he has with his homosexuality, somewhat assuaged by his many trysts with very young rent boys. Of course I didn't expect porn, but the few decent shots of nude males were mostly either too dark to see anything or were obscured by the english subtitles. There is exactly one male/male kiss. All the while the few in the know including himself keep saying if they discover he's a homosexual, he will never be elected Secretary General. He toys with the idea of resigning. Supposedly he falls in love with the last rent boy, his wife decides she's had enough pretending not to know and they foolishly embark on a threesome, sexually and non-sexually getting photographed extensively by the opposition. The rent boy is interrogated about the photos, then kidnapped, and Roberto has to go to where they are holding him, Roberto's own secret apartment but when he arrives the boy has already been murdered. As the movie continues it seems he decided not to resign, the final scene shows a crowd and he with a few others are on a podium - apparently he was elected Secretary General after all. At this point the film abruptly ends and we have no idea what ultimately happens with the ""discovery of scandal"" (or if it even occurred) that loomed over the whole darn film. I did not enjoy this."

set up their camp. That night, Smit again reminds Zoltan of their mission and sends him out, where the other vampire dogs are waiting for him to lead them. Armed with wooden stakes, Michael stays with the car and Branco goes
looking around. Branco finds the hearse and Smit attacks him. After a fierce struggle, Branco overpowers Smit and drives a wooden stake into his heart, destroying him. The three vampire dogs find Michael, and he barely makes it back to the
convertible in time to get inside and put up the top. While the dogs try to tear through the convertible from the side, the back and the top, Michael recognizes Annie as one of his attackers.

Just then, Branco arrives, followed by the two fishermen, both of them carrying rifles. One of them shoots each of the three vampire dogs, but again the bullets have no effect on them and they keep tearing away at the car as though nothing had happened.

leaving only Zoltan still among the undead. Zoltan runs off and Michael goes after
him. He corners Zoltan on top of a ridge, where the dog tries to hypnotize him.
He resists, tears open his shirt, exposes his silver crucifix and forces Zoltan back and over the ridge,

of the tall wooden fence below that he had previously leaped over four days before.

Michael assures them that Branco has told them the truth and that it is all over now. When one of the fishermen asks about what is to be done with the dead dogs, Branco says that they and Smit are to be burned to ashes and those ashes are to be scattered into the wind. ""You can go home now, Mr. Drake. That was the last of them,"" says Branco. ""Thank God,"" says Michael."

He then runs footage on the moviola of a question and answer session he conducted during a 1977 screening of Othello in Boston. Welles concludes the film in his position as a monologuist, proclaiming: ""There are too many regrets, there are too many things I wish I could have done over again. If it wasn't a memory, if it was a project for the future, talking about Othello would have been nothing but delight. After all, promises are more fun than explanations. In all my heart, I wish that I wasn't looking back on Othello, but looking forward to it. That Othello would be one hell of a picture. Goodnight."""

The team decides to infiltrate the German marshaling yards at Mostar to steal explosives, taking Lescovar and Marko.

Marko overhears the plan and sacrifices himself to save the others from the Germans. The others escape with Lescovar aboard a train leaving for Sarajevo. Lescovar's hasty cover story doesn't fool Mallory or Barnsby; Barnsby had observed Lescovar's interactions with the German sergeant who, fatally, salutes the other man even though Lescovar's uniform only made him out to be a corporal; Mallory had noticed a map showing that their train passes within a half-mile of the dam - a fact Lescovar ""neglected"" to bring up. Though Lescovar denies treachery, Mallory is convinced, and he kills Lescovar."

Renata is a renowned poet, who lives largely on Arthur being her benefactor. Renata is married to Frederick, a novelist, whose works achieve little acclaim. As such, Frederick feels emasculated by Renata's success, she who states that her praise for his work is truthful, and not just a means to stoke his ego. Joey, the second who suffers from middle child syndrome, is the bright but directionless one living in Renata's shadow. Joey has moved from one unfulfilling career to another. Due solely to proximity, Joey is largely tasked with Eve's post-hospitalization care, despite she knowing that her mother treats her like the unwanted child. Conversely, Arthur has always viewed Joey as the special one to who he always looks for validation. Joey is in a long term cohabitational relationship with Michael, a political activist who knows that Eve doesn't like him and who in turn doesn't like that Joey lets Eve run roughshod over their lives. And Flyn, the youngest, is the pretty one. She is a Hollywood television actress who fully realizes that what minor fame and fortune she has received is solely due to her looks. The lives of this collective becomes even more complicated when Arthur begins dating Pearl, who is the antithesis of Eve in every respect and who he wants to marry."

"Early in the Second Age of Middle-earth, elven smiths forged nine Rings of Power for mortal men, seven for the Dwarf-Lords, and three for the Elf-Kings. At the same time, the Dark Lord Sauron made the One Ring to rule them all after learning the secrets of how to forge them from the Elves of Hollin--a deviation from Tolkien's work in which Sauron taught ring lore to the Elves and forged all the rings except the three Elvish rings. As the Last Alliance of Elves and Men fell, the Ring fell into the hands of Prince Isildur from across the sea, and after Isildur was killed by orcs, the Ring lay at the bottom of the river Anduin. Over time, Sauron captured the nine Rings made for men and turned their owners into the Ringwraiths, terrible beings who roamed the world searching for the One Ring. The Ring was found by a Stoor named Déagol, whose friend, Sméagol, murdered him and stole it for himself. The Ring warped Sméagol into a twisted, gurgling wretch known only as Gollum (Peter Woodthorpe), and he wandered with it to a cave in the Misty Mountains. Hundreds of years later, the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Norman Bird) accidentally discovered his ""precious"" Ring and took it back with him to the Shire.
Years later, during Bilbo's birthday celebrations in the Shire, the wizard Gandalf (William Squire) tells him to leave the Ring for Frodo Baggins (Christopher Guard). Bilbo agrees, and leaves the Shire. Seventeen years pass, during which Gandalf learns that the Shire is in danger: evil forces have discovered that the Ring is in the possession of a Baggins. Gandalf meets with Frodo to explain the Ring's history and the danger it poses to all of Middle-earth. Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him.
He is accompanied by three hobbit friends, Pippin (Dominic Guard), Merry (Simon Chandler), and Sam (Michael Scholes). After a narrow escape from the Ringwraiths pursuing them, the hobbits eventually come to Bree, where they meet Aragorn (John Hurt), who is first introduced to them as Strider, a friend of Gandalf's, who leads them the rest of the way to Rivendell. Frodo is stabbed atop Weathertop mountain by the chief of the Ringwraiths with a knife imbued with evil magic. Part of the knife stays inside him, and he gets sicker as the journey progresses. The Ringwraiths catch up with them shortly after they meet the elf Legolas (Anthony Daniels), and at a standoff at the ford of Rivendell, the Ringwraiths are swept away by the enchanted river. At Rivendell, Frodo is healed by its lord, Elrond. He meets Gandalf again, held captive by his fellow wizard Saruman (Fraser Kerr), who plans to join with Sauron but also wants the Ring for himself. Bilbo, Gandalf, and the others argue about what should be done with the One Ring, and Frodo volunteers to go to Mordor, where the Ring can be destroyed. Frodo sets off from Rivendell with eight companions: Gandalf; Aragorn; Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor (Michael Graham Cox); Legolas; Gimli the dwarf (David Buck); and Frodo's original three hobbit companions.
Their attempt to cross the Misty Mountains is foiled by heavy snow, and they are forced to take a path under the mountains via Moria. Moria was an ancient dwarf kingdom, but is now full of orcs and other evil creatures, and Gandalf falls into an abyss while battling a balrog. The remaining eight members of the Fellowship continue through the elf-haven Lothlórien, but Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo. Frodo decides to leave the others behind and continue his quest alone, although faithful Sam insists on accompanying him.
Boromir is killed by orcs while trying to defend Merry and Pippin. They are captured by the orcs, who intend to take them to Isengard through the land of Rohan. The hobbits escape and flee into Fangorn forest, where they meet Treebeard (John Westbrook), a huge tree-like creature. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas find Merry and Pippin; they find small footprints and follow them into Fangorn Forest. There, they find Gandalf, whom they believed had died in the mines of Moria. The four ride to Rohan's capital, Edoras, where Gandalf persuades King Théoden (Philip Stone) that his people are in danger. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas then travel to the defensive fortification Helm's Deep.
Frodo and Sam, meanwhile, discover Gollum stalking them, and capture him. Frodo pities him, and lets him live in return for guidance to Mount Doom. Gollum promises to lead them to a secret entrance to Mordor. At Helm's Deep, Théoden's forces struggle to resist an onslaught of orcs sent by Saruman. Gandalf arrives the next morning with the Riders of Rohan just in time, destroying the orc army."

He is told that he will be released if he cooperates with the authorities in identifying the person who sold him the hashish. Billy's troubles really begin when after that assistance, he makes a run for it and is recaptured.

"Who was Moliere? He is known everywhere as one of the world's greatest playwrights. But who was he? Born Jean-Baptiste Poquelin in 1622, the son of a prosperous tapestry maker. His mother died when he was a boy. Growing up in the teeming streets of 17th century Paris, Jean Baptiste received a good Jesuit education and was fascinated by the street fairs and traveling carnivals that flourished in spite of the religious repression and hypocrisy of those cruel times. As a young man he joined the theatrical Bejart family to establish the Illustre-Theatre, which soon went bankrupt. The troupe reformed, found patronage, and went on the road for thirteen years, performing all over France. Poquelin developed his stagecraft adapting Commedia dell Arte plots to please brutalized peasants and cynical townspeople. He also married Madeline Bejart, the widowed daughter of the troupe's founder. Later he entered into a love affair with Mme Bejart's daughter, to the dismay of all. The troupe eventually returned to Paris and, on October 24, 1658, greatly impressed the 20-year old King Louis XIV, later to be called the Sun King.

Otter has as his 2IC Donald Schoenstein - ""Boon"" - whose supportive girlfriend Katy doesn't much like the fact of Boon, Otter and the others' idea of a good time being to get constantly drunk. At the bottom of the Delta barrel is John Blutarsky - ""Bluto"" - the chief troublemaker with a 0.0 GPA. Within the Delta environment, Larry and Kent - renamed ""Pinto"" and ""Flounder"" respectively by the fraternity - blossom socially as much as they can by being accepted for who they are, but end up being sucked into the goings-on for good or bad of their fraternity brothers. The college's dean, Vernon Wormer, with the help of the stuck up members of Omega Theta Pi led by preppy Greg Marmalard, has vowed to find some way to revoke Delta's charter and expel its members for what seems to be their joy at and singular goal of disrupting life on campus in any way they can. Their general battles take on personal undertones with the involvement of a few women: Mandy Pepperidge, Greg's girlfriend who isn't as innocent as she likes to appear; southern belle Babs Jansen, Mandy's sorority sister who is in love with Greg and thus will willingly throw Mandy under the proverbial bus to get into Greg's heart and pants; and Marion Wormer, the Dean's bored wife. Throughout the battle, the ultimate question becomes which side will have the final move to trump all others."

"We open several years after the events of the previous film. A flying saucer leaves Witch Mountain headed for Los Angeles. It lands in the middle of Rose Bowl Stadium, and it's passengers disembark. Tony and Tia Malone, now teenagers, are being dropped off by their uncle Bene for a well-earned vacation in the city, having spent the previous years helping to develop their colony of extra-terrestrial survivors and learning to master their supernatural powers. They come to the locked front gate and Tony uses telekinesis to fly over it, but Uncle Bene has Tia simply unlock it instead. He tells the kids not to use their powers unless absolutely necessary to avoid unwanted attention, and tells them to focus on enjoying their vacation. They are picked up by an egocentric taxi driver named Eddie, who claims to have a perfect safety record despite his reckless driving. The children enjoy the drive through LA even so.
A black car pulls into a quiet back street, and three people get out. Eccentric scientist Doctor Victor Gannon, his benefactor Letha Wedge, and her nephew and henchman Sickle. Gannon is about to test his new experiment on Sickle; a mind control device. Gannon tells Sickle, who has a fear of heights, to climb one of the tall buildings to the roof, and when Sickle refuses, Gannon activates the mind control device. Speaking into a control box, he reiterates his command, and Sickle complies.
Tia and Tony notice the cab beginning to stutter. Eddie was so busy complaining about the other drivers on the road that he failed to notice the taxi running out of gas. They pull over and Eddie walks to a gas station to get a new can. When Eddie leaves, Tony and Tia have a premonition of someone falling. Tony tells Tia to wait by the cab for Eddie while he investigates to try and help. Tia agrees and tells him to be careful, and Tony goes to where he thinks the vision came from.
Gannon is thrilled at the success of his device, and tells Sickle to walk along the roof ledge, which he does. Letha is nervous Sickle will fall, and tries to take the control box from Gannon, who drops it in the struggle. The control box is damaged, and Gannon can no longer command Sickle, who is continuing to walk toward the end of the roof. Tony rounds the corner just as Sickle steps off the edge. Using his powers, he stops Sickle just before he hits the ground, and helps him to the sidewalk. Gannon and Letha are astonished, and Victor puts together very quickly that the boy is responsible for this miracle. He tells Letha he needs him for his experiments, and Letha distracts Tony while Gannon comes up behind him and jabs him with a tranquilizer needle, knocking him unconscious. Tia immediately feels that something is wrong, and runs to investigate. She gets there too late to see Gannon, Letha, and Sickle take off with Tony in their car. Eddie returns with the gas can, and upon finding the taxi unoccupied, leaves without the children. Unable to find Tony, Tia returns to where the taxi was, only to find it gone. Tia wanders the city looking for Tony, and stumbles into a group of boys running from a rival gang of much tougher kids. They tell her to run to and she follows them. Tia and the boys run into a closed off alleyway and hide, but their pursuers are closing in. Tia uses her telekinesis to fight the rival gang, giving her and the other boys time to get away. They thank her for her help and introduce themselves as the Earthquake Gang; Rocky, Muscles, Crusher, and Dazzler. They are would-be tough kids trying to establish themselves as a real gang, but it is clear to Tia that they are in over their heads. Despite this, they offer to help her find Tony. After spending all day searching, they come up empty.
Tia does not have a place to stay, since Uncle Bene had pre-arranged a hotel but gave Eddie the address, and Eddie drove away with all their luggage, so the Earthquakes offer to put her up in their hideout. On the way, they dodge a man in a minibus looking for the boys. The gang tells Tia the man is a truant officer named ""Yoyo"" Yokomoto. They successfully evade him and make it to the hideout. The hideout itself is the attic of an old abandoned house in a construction supply area. While the Earthquakes discuss what to do next, Tia suddenly gets a connection with Tony. Concentrating, she can only see a light shining down. After a few moments, the vision goes black.
Across the city at Letha's mansion, Tony, still knocked out, is strapped to a table in Gannon's laboratory in the cellar. Even unconscious, Tony is putting out too much energy to measure, shorting out Gannon's equipment. Gannon is repairing his mind control device and plans to use it on Tony, plotting to become the most influential man in the world with a super powered person at his bidding. Letha, however, is merely concerned with seeing a return on her investment, claiming that building Gannon's laboratory has left her bankrupt, and now nervous about the kidnapping. Gannon brushes her off, but she warns him that he'd better find a way to make her some capital with his invention. Tony begins to regain consciousness wake up, allowing for Tia's momentary contact with him, but Victor quickly injects him with more sedative and he passes out again.
The Earthquakes have to go home, revealing that they still have families and haven't worked up the nerve to run away and start their gang for real yet, but promise to return in the morning with breakfast. Tia thanks them for their kindness, which discourages them since they want to be bad boys.
The next day, Gannon has finished placing the tiny mind control device on Tony, hidden behind his ear. He activates it and it works perfectly. He wakes Tony up, and immediately Tia has another telepathic vision. She can temporarily see what Tony sees, which is just the laboratory machines and surgical instruments. Tia mistakes this for a hospital room, and she and the Earthquakes go to check the all the hospitals. Gannon asks Tony who he is and about his powers, and Tony has no choice but to tell him. Victor orders a demonstration of his powers, and Tony effortlessly unstraps himself from the table. Sickle is skeptical, so Gannon has Tony make an anesthesia canister chase him, and also has him stack multiple heavy wine casks to prove to Letha. She and Victor toast to the possibilities.
Tia and the boys have searched every hospital in town, and no sign of Tony. Tia tries to contact him, but his mind is blank. The boys promise to keep looking.
That night, Letha discusses the situation with Sickle. She imagines gambling in Las Vegas with Tony controlling the dice, but first she needs money to gamble with. Luckily, she sees an opportunity in the form of a huge stack of gold on display at a local museum. Sickle points out that Gannon won't allow Letha to use Tony to steal the gold, but she doesn't plan to ask permission.
Tia lays awake in bed at the hideout, trying to connect telepathically with Tony, who is asleep in Gannon's lab. The mind control device prevents Tia from getting through.
The next day, Gannon goes into town to run errands, and Letha takes the opportunity to use the control box and take Tony to the museum. They arrive with a large crowd at the exhibit, and as Tony looks around, Tia gets another scattered vision. She describes what she sees, and Dazzler recognizes it as the gold exhibit at the museum. They make their way there.
Letha orders Tony to cause a diversion at the exhibit, including making a stagecoach roll out of control, making the dummies move, and destroying the security system. Pandemonium breaks out, and the security guards are completely occupied trying to stop the chaos.
Victor returns from his errands to find Tony gone, and angerly goes to Letha's study, finding the newspaper article about the gold.
Letha tells Tony to break the glass case and send the gold bars to Sickle outside, and Tony complies. Sickle however is unprepared for how heavy the gold is, and gets out of the way as the bars start flying at him. Tia and the gang arrive and find Sickle hiding under his car from the gold bars pelting the trunk. They get inside just in time to see the last of the gold floating out, and take in the madness going on around them. As Letha moves to leave with Tony, Tia starts to reverse what he has done. Tony reveals it's not his doing. Tia spots Tony and gets his attention, and Tony tells Letha that Tia is his sister and is like him. Letha runs out with the boy in tow and meets Sickle, who's car is completely crushed by the gold bars, and Victor, who has arrived and is furious with Letha. Tia puts an end to the last of the chaos inside, and chases after her older brother. She and the Earthquakes see Tony getting into a car with his captors, and Tia uses her powers to stop the engine from turning on. Letha explains about Tia to Victor, who commands Tony to override her and make the car start. Tia is unable to stop them as they drive away. Just then, Yoyo arrives trying to catch the boys, but Tia convinces them not to run away. They all jump into the minibus and Tia tells Yoyo to chase after the car, saying her brother is also a truant. Yoyo excitedly agrees, and Tia takes control of the van.
An intense chase commences. Gannon orders Tony to stop the van, but for every obstacle he puts in their way, Tia uses her powers to get around them, including lifting a school bus and making the van fly over a train. The minibus takes a beating, but Tia keeps it going. Victor stops over a steep hill and has Tony magnify the sun's reflection, blinding their pursuers and causing them to crash. Victor and his group get away as Tia and the Earthquakes leave Yoyo to deal with a police officer.
Gannon is fuming at Letha over the museum incident, but tells her he has a plan that will get them both what they want; money and prestige. Letha tells him that they still need to deal with Tia, as she might find them again and ruin their plans. Victor asks Tony how Tia found them and he explains her telepathy. Victor decides to use this to his advantage to get rid of her permanently.
Tia is awoken from sleep by a telepathic message from Tony. He tells her he has lost his powers and needs help, and lures her to Letha's mansion. She breaks in and goes to the lab. She is surprised by Gannon's lab animal, a goat named Alfred, but keeps looking for Tony. She finds him tied to a chair and blindfolded, but as she approaches, Sickle jumps her and knocks her out with chloroform. Gannon puts her in a portable chamber with anesthetic gas, leaving her unconscious.
The Earthquakes get to the hideout to find Tia missing, and worry about where she might have gone.
Tia is able to barely wake up, but is immobilized by the gas. She empathically asks Alfred the goat to go get help, and sends him to find the Earthquake gang. Alfred breaks out of the house and makes his way across the city.
Gannon, Sickle, Letha, and Tony drive to a plutonium processing plant. Gannon plans to make Tony threaten to cause a nuclear meltdown unless a ransom is paid. They drive right in, Tony getting rid of the gate guard and security scanners.
Alfred comes across Eddie's Taxi, and butts another passenger out to steal his ride. Eddie tries to brag about getting a safety award from his cab company soon, and doesn't immediately notice the goat in his backseat. When he does however, it distracts him and he crashes the cab. Alfred jumps out and makes it to the hideout, frightening the boys. He grabs Tia's jacket to get the gang to chase him back to the mansion.
Gannon and company get into the furnace area of the plutonium plant, levitating a guard to get out of their way, and sealing the door behind them.
The Earthquakes follow Alfred to the laboratory and find Tia. They shut off the gas and help her recover, and she has a vision of the round top of the plutonium plant. Describing it, Crusher thinks he knows where Tony must be, and they all race to find it.
Gannon commands Tony to shut off the cooling system and the furnace begins to overheat. Alarms go off in the control center, but they are unable to restart the system. Gannon calls to deliver his ultimatum: he will allow the plant to explode and destroy everything in the area unless they are given five million dollars, safe escort to an airport, and worldwide recognition of Gannon's scientific genius. The plant officials call and evacuation and scramble to get the money.
Crusher leads Tia and the others to a mini golf course with a large golf ball on the sign, but obviously, this is not what Tia saw. They notice Yoyo mulling around his destroyed van, but he seems uninterested in catching them. Curious, they go and ask him why he isn't chasing them, and he reveals that report of the crash got back to the Board of Education, and they are coming down to fire him for destroying city property. He admits that he just wanted to help the kids get a good education so they wouldn't wind up on the streets, which makes the boys feel guilty. Over the radio, they hear about the crisis at the plutonium plant, and Tia recognizes the problems as being caused by Tony's abilities. She is able to power the van enough to get there, and Yoyo drives the group to the plant.
The plant director calls Gannon to offer him all the money they've gathered so far, saying the furnace will go critical soon. Letha wants to take the deal, but Gannon will not compromise.
The surface of the plutonium plant is in chaos when Tia and her group arrives. They go to the control center and Tia gets the director to explain where the overload is so she can fix it. She and to boys make it through the evacuating employees to the furnace level deep underground. Tia spots Tony from a catwalk and calls out to him, alerting Gannon, Letha, and Sickle to their presence. Tia tries to get through to her brother telepathically, willing him to remember her. Tony tries to fight against the control, but Gannon's device overpowers him. Gannon orders Letha and Sickle to catch the Earthquakes while he deals with Tia, who splits up with the gang to find the cooling system. Gannon commands Tony to eliminate Tia by crashing into her with a heavy console, but Tia spots it coming and cuts it off with one of her own, and is able to evade Gannon. Crusher and Rocky find her and show her to the Emergency Cooling System, and she sends them away while she begins to focus on turning the coolant back on. On a panel, Victor notices the furnace temperature cooling, and orders Tony to turn it off again. Tia and Tony struggle against eachother over control of the system, but Tia eventually wins out and the system is restored, much to the relief of the plant staff, who had just finished gathering the cash. Gannon takes Tony and sees Tia across the cavernous furnace room. He hides around the corner and orders Tony to kill his sister. He sends a metal rail flying at her, but she blocks it with a door. Tia tries to get through to him again as he sends a giant pylon, which she also blocks. Victor tells Tony to pretend to remember Tia and lure her under a several ton crane box. He complies, and Tia walks under the steel booth, which Tony drops on her. Tia tries to hold up the crane, but is in danger of being crushed. Gannon runs out and orders Tony to force the crane and kill her, but Tia notices the control box in his hand. Putting the pieces together, she destroys the box, releasing Tony from Gannon's control. She replaces the crane, and sends the box flying down the halls away from Victor, who chases it. Tony is dazed and confused, but Tia removes the device from behind his ear and helps him remember everything that has occurred since they were separated.
With the control box disintegrated, Gannon tries to convince Tony and Tia to work with him anyway. Tony responds by levitating him a hundred feet in the air and setting him down on a painting scaffold hung from the ceiling. Letha and Sickle arrive with the Earthquakes in tow, but Tony and Tia send them up to join Victor and leave them for the police.
Some time later, Yoyo and the Earthquakes drop the siblings off at Rose Bowl Stadium to wait for Uncle Bene. Tia explains that without them, the van won't run, so she and Tony meticulously restore the van with their powers. With the minibus as good as new, the Board of Education no longer has a reason to fire Yoyo, especially if the Rocky, Muscles, Crusher, and Dazzler go to school, which they agree to. Tony and Tia levitate themselves and the gang over the fence to the stadium, and they say goodbye to the boys. They meet Uncle Bene at the UFO, and when asked how their vacation went and why they are missing their luggage, Tony suggests they go surfing next time instead.
The Earthquakes climb back over the fence and go with Yoyo, and catch a glimpse of the flying saucer on it's way home."

"Arthur Kirkland is a principled and dedicated Baltimore-based defense attorney. He stands up for what he believes in, and as such has spent time in jail for contempt for what he believed was the unfair treatment by the judge, Henry Fleming, for his innocent client, Jeff McCullaugh. It is thus well known that Arthur hates Fleming. It is because of that public knowledge that Fleming requests Arthur to be his defense attorney when he is charged with the violent rape of Leah Shepard. Due to circumstances, Arthur has no other option but to take Judge Fleming's case. As the case progresses, the judicial system around Arthur seems to be crumbling. His law partner, Jay Porter, is slowly falling apart due to the guilt associated with the actions of guilty clients for whom he got acquittals. Judge Fleming still seems to be stalling on Arthur's request to review McCullaugh's case, McCullaugh who is still in prison, where he has been beaten and raped. In dealing with other issues, Arthur asks another colleague, Warren Fresnell, to handle the probation hearing for another of his clients, scared transvestite Ralph Agee; however, unknown to Arthur, Warren is more concerned with his billable time than he is in doing his colleague a favor. With all this happening around Arthur and evidence emerging that Fleming is indeed innocent of the charges against him, he is more determined than ever to see that justice is done, even for Fleming who he still hates. This goal is affected by the determination of the prosecutor, Frank Bowers, whose sole mission seems to be to see Fleming in jail as a figurative trophy on his mantelpiece, and the seeming self death wish of the presiding judge, Francis Rayford. Arthur uses as his ethical and legal touchstones his new girlfriend, Gail Patrick, a member of the legal ethics committee, and his paternal grandfather Sam, who raised him, is the reason that he became a lawyer, is his only surviving family member and who is slowly deteriorating from dementia."

This behavior includes spying on a neighbor's sexual encounters with a wide array of women, this spying about which the neighbor knows, as he does it himself. Driving one day, George spots a young woman who he believes is the most beautiful creature he's ever seen - an ""eleven"" on a scale of ten, tens which he didn't believe existed before her.

At her residence in New York City, Annie explains to her husband that she wants to be in Miami for Billy's fight, sensing that her presence will make a difference. On the night of the match at Miami's Forum, T. J. and Billy are excited to see Annie in the crowd. During an early round, Billy looks strong and knocks his opponent, Bowers, to the floor. In the next round, Billy receives a cut near his eye, but fights back. As the match continues, Billy is briefly knocked down and staggers to his feet, experiencing double vision. When he goes down a second time, the referee considers stopping the fight as Billy's cut continues to bleed. Jackie and T. J. also want to end the fight, but Billy assures them he is okay. All of a sudden, Billy finds a second wind and knocks out Bowers for the victory. He holds up his son as the crowd cheers, but T. J. is alarmed by his father's disorientated and swollen appearance. While leaning against Jackie on the way back to the locker room, Billy collapses. He lies on the table and tells his son that Annie is a good person and to be happy because he won the fight. As Billy dies, T. J. calls for ""The Champ"" and asks the other trainers to wake him, but Jackie announces Billy is gone. When she enters the room, Annie goes to her son and hugs him."

"This is a 1979 film directed by Marco Ferreri, winner of the Silver Bear, grand jury prize at the 1979 Berlin Film Festival.
For the first time in a nursery school in Corticella (Bologna) a male teacher takes service. Roberto, this is his name, is an excellent educator, who immediately has an excellent relationship with children (who among other things greatly appreciate the unusual non ""maternal"" presence in the teaching staff), and with colleagues; however his educational methods, rather unconventional and inspired by a great freedom, will lead him to have some problems with law enforcement officers.
Roberto, a kindergarten teacher, is well received by his colleagues, loved by the children, but hindered by parents who do not understand his relationships with their children. A special bond is born with a psychically disturbed child. M. Ferreri made an open film, an extraordinary fable that goes in search of itself, passing through the scenes of everyday life and fiction and following the non-story of a delicate and poignant Benigni.
Roberto establishes a relationship with Isabella, the unmarried mother of his pupil Michela, and the woman finds herself pregnant again; moreover, he is particularly friendly with Gianluigi, a child suffering from behavioral disorders, who does not speak and eats very little and in consideration of this he is removed from kindergarten to be hosted in a nursing home. In the following summer, Isabella, close to giving birth, expresses her intention to move to Sardinia where she owns a disused cinema. Roberto, although not expressly invited to follow her, accompanies her together with a group of children including Gianluigi. Just on the day when Isabella gives birth to her second child, Gianluigi begins to show the first real signs of healing."
"KXLA Television human interest reporter Kimberly Wells aspires to do hard hitting news stories, whereas station brass wants to keep her to her current position; they're more concerned about the color, length and style of her hair than her investigative abilities. While doing a human interest story at the Ventana nuclear power plant, she may have stumbled onto her dream story when on-site she witnesses what she thinks is a near nuclear disaster. Her freelance cameraman and friend, Richard Adams, clandestinely films the event as it unfolds in Ventana's control room. However, station brass quashes the story due in part to liability issues. Although disappointed, Kimberly initially follows her boss' directives as she wants to protect her career path, whereas Richard wants to use the film to really find out what happened. Uncovering the truth hits an early snag when the regulatory commission reports that the plant faced no major issue during the incident. Both Kimberly and Richard believe the quick and favorable report was due to the fact that development of another nuclear power plant is currently going through the public consultation process. Back at the plant, Jack Godell, the supervisor on duty in the control room during the incident, believes that something indeed is wrong with the plant due to the event, when he felt a tremor on-site. His beliefs are strengthened due to some radioactive leak in the plant from an unknown source and the discovery of some falsified documents, the latter which he knows may be a threat to his life by the perpetrators. Jack, with Kimberly and Richard's help, does whatever he can to get his story into the public consciousness to avert what he thinks is a potential nuclear meltdown at the plant. But the power company is determined to keep Jack quiet and to protect their billion dollar investment, namely Ventana."
"Cord gets his next clue of the upcoming Trial. Cord meets a man standing in a barrel of oil. This man has been inside of the barrel for 10 years. He is trying to melt off his penis. His legs are like spaghetti, and his penis is just a wisp. He is doing this because he can't prevent himself from having affairs (after making 100 Vows of Celibacy over the years, and lacking the courage to cut his penis off). His wife (after earlier not liking the idea) supports him living in the barrel, and even brings him food to eat. When Cord tells him he's looking for Zetan, the man warns him that sex will get in the way, and that Cord will falter in his search because of his sex drive. Then he invites Cord to get in the barrel with him (because -- he thinks -- Cord will fail, just like the man did, and then Cord will want to melt his off ). Cord laughs, and walks off. Cord has taken a Vow of Chastity a year before, and he ""knows"" that he will remain faithful to his Vow until he attains Enlightenment. The man in the oil was weak about sex, but Cord is NOT weak."
"William Dudley is a corrupt mayor of a nameless Midwestern U.S. city who has allowed a chemical refinery to be built right in the center of town, far from any river, lake or reservoir. On one typical hot summer day, Herman Stover, a dangerously disturbed employee at the works has been denied an expected promotion and in addition, finds himself fired. He then decides to take his revenge against the works by opening the valves to the storage vats and their interconnecting pipes, flooding the area and sewers with gasoline and chemicals. It doesn't take long for this act of petty vandalism to start a fire, which starts a chain reaction that causes massive explosions at the refinery, destroying it and spreading a mushroom-cloud of flame that soon engulfs the entire metropolis! The drama focuses on a newly built hospital which, like the refinery and all civic buildings that went up during the mayor's crooked administration, is shoddily built and poorly equipped where the head doctor, Frank Whitman, and his staff treat thousands of casualties from the city-fire while the city fire chief Risley keeps in constant contact with the fire companies fighting a losing battle against the fires, and Maggie Grayson, an alcoholic reporter/newscaster, sees it as her chance to make it nationwide with her coverage of the story of the 'city on fire.'"

The village is populated by inhabitants who barely survive on the meager harvest of the unyielding land. Eboli, the closest train station, is the last outpost of civilization (such as it is) before entering a world that has changed very little since the Middle Ages.

"The first sequence is a five minute documentary narrated by Grigori Aleksandrov. While relevant still photos are shown, we learn that in 1931, director Sergei M. Eisenstein, producer Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse came to USA for talks with Paramount, but no agreement resulted. This team was responsible for the successful prior films Battleship Potemkin and October. Some funding was arranged by writer Upton Sinclair, and the team went to Mexico to make a movie about its history and culture. With advice from Mexican intellectuals and artists, they traveled around Mexico and shot film. For a variety of financial and political reasons, Upton Sinclair deposited the film in Museum of Modern Art in New York for safekeeping. Eisenstein was never allowed to edit this movie. In 1979, the Soviet Union government retrieved the shot film and Grigori Aleksandrov prepared this version, using notes, sketches, and narration written by Eisenstein in addition to Aleksandrov's own recollections."

"The Third Generation was once regarded as a highly controversial film in Germany. The Film opens in a high rise overlooking Berlin, Germany, as the sound of a heart beating and the T.V. are heard. Peter Lurz (Eddie Constantine), a well to do and established man in his 60s who sells computers, is looking out the window as his secretary Susanne Gast (Hanna Schygulla) is on the phone behind him. A man in his mid 50s wearing a putty colored trench coat and a hat, Officer Gerhard Gast (Hark Bohm), who's there to pick up Susanne, his daughter in law, engages in a conversation with Lurz. Officer Gast tells Lurz that he is being watched and is under police protection. In route of taking his daughter in-law home for dinner they both have a sexual experience at a hotel room. While having dinner with the whole family, Grandpa Gast (Claus Holm) tells the husband of Susanne, Edgar Gast (Udo Kier) that every generation needs a war. In all this we see visuals pop up of reported headlines of racial and hateful graffiti in public places. Susanne makes her rounds to other contacts. She approaches Hilde Kriger (Bulle Ogier), a school teacher, and tells her ""The world as will and idea,"" a common code phase that is used amongst the terrorist.
This is when sound takes the floor in this movie. Characters are introduced sporadically. August Brem (Volker Spengler) approaches Rudolf Mann (Harry Baer) in a record store where he works. The phrase ""the world as will and idea"" is spoken to him almost like a calling. Petra Vielhabor (Margrit Carstensen) who argues with her husband Hans (Jurgen Draegon) constantly gets the calling. During this time, when all of the characters are introduced, they are surrounded by noise from music, T.V. and radio. They are all extremely paranoid and tense. Their are to meet at Rudolf's apartment so they could meet Paul (Raul Grimenez), their so called leader of the terrorist group. While at the apartment they almost agree to kick out Ilse Hoffman (Y So Lo), a drug addict. They feel that she is a threat. August mentions it first to Rudolph who does nothing because he has compassion for her. Paul arrives and their so excited to see him for the first time. He makes forced arrangements to stay with Hilde in her apartment and rapes her. Two visitors come to see Ilse, Franz Walsch (Günther Kaufman) and Bernhard Von Stein (Vitus Zepichal). Franz is a long time friend and lover of Ilse. They decide to stay with her and help her drug problem. The others find books in Von Stein's suitcase and start tossing it around as Von Stein cries for it back. They act like children playing in a field.
Times are tense and get even worse when Paul is gunned down at a restaurant in front of Edgar who's faced by his father at the site. They are all afraid and decide to change their identity. August gives out paper squares to the group. Some have a mark and some don't. Petra, Rudolf and Hilde got the mark and had to break into the post office. Rudolph peed in his pants, he was so scared. The others laugh when they get back but not for long when Franz finds Ilse dead. Petra and some of the other terrorists rob the very bank that Petra's husband works in. While they are escaping, Petra shoots and kills her husband. They frantically change their looks and names and flee from their homes.
Von Stein is seriously interrogated by Officer Gast as to their whereabouts. Von Stein genuinely doesn't know but gets curious and follows August undetected. He sees Lurz give August money to fund terrorism at a Chinese restaurant. August sets up Franz by telling him where Ilse is buried. He then calls the authorities and gets him killed. August does the same to Petra when she is instructed to place a bomb and gets intercepted and killed by police. Von Stein is caught by Officer Gast at the cemetery when he tried to warn Franz that it was a setup and not to go to Ilse's grave. Von Stein tells Officer Gast of what he saw at the Chinese restaurant and mysteriously falls down a long flight of stairs and is killed. Paul Lurz is willingly kidnapped by the remaining terrorists and videotaped in a basement as he slates his name and his position in the state."

"The film opens with a portrait of Adolf Hitler hanging on a brick wall. Suddenly an explosion blows a hole through the wall and inside is Maria Braun (Hanna Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) about to get married. What is supposed to be a ceremonial and memorable moment for them has turned violent as bombs are going off around them. The setting is Berlin during World War II. As the ceremony is brought to a halt by the bombs, the Priest attempts to leave only to be stopped by Hermann. Separated for a brief moment as bombs continue to rain around them, Maria, Hermann, and Priest take cover on the ground and are finally able to sign their marriage license. After the opening of the credits, we see Marias mother eating a small piece of bread with a tiny drizzle of oil. The economic times are bad. Maria returns after being unable to sell off her wedding dress. However, she does not return empty handed. Amongst the things she brings back is a shaving brush. Then catching a photo of her husband Hermann, she begins to break into tears. Hermann has been sent to the front. With her mother cheering her up, they decide to cook up some potatoes with bacon.
With a poster hanging behind her back with the information of Hermann, Maria waits with anticipation at the train station, where the women wait for the men to arrive from the war. However, Hermann doesn't show up. Taking refuge in a soup kitchen, Maria talks to a woman working in the kitchen about the death of her husband in the war and remarriage. These are desperate times for everyone as several men dive for a cigarette butt thrown by a soldier. Heckled by a couple of American soldiers, Maria's strength is revealed as she confronts one of them, only to be given a packet of cigarettes. She decides to give it to her mother only in exchange for her brooch, which the mother agrees to. In the following scene, we see Maria once again roaming the city with the poster of Hermann hanging on her back. This time she is accompanied by her friend Betti Klenze (Elisabeth Trissenaar), who also has a poster of her husband Willy Klenze (Gottfried John) dangling on her back. Near the end of the day, they help each other put on heavy makeup in order to search for a job that their husbands might or might not approve. Maria believes that Hermann would have no qualms about her. On the following day, Maria meets up with a peddler (Rainer Werner Fassbinder) who trades a dress for her in return for Maria's brooch. She wears the elegant dress and manages to find a job as a waitress in a bar. Paying a visit to her childhood doctor (Claus Holm), she asks for a health certificate for her new employer. The following morning, she returns back to the train station and doesn't find Hermann. Giving up on her hope, she tears Hermann's photo off and tosses the poster board onto the train tracks. At her new job at the bar, she meets and shares a dance with Bill (George Eagles), an African-American soldier. Spending an afternoon in the woods, as Bill teaches Maria English, their relationship suddenly has become more passionate and intimate. In the next scene, we see Betti reunited with her husband Willy. However, he brings with him the news of Hermann's death. Maria returns and is shocked to find Willy back. Although ecstatic to have Willy back, Maria cries because her husband is not with her. Her only means of comfort now is in Bill. As Bill and Marias relationship begins to grow more intimate and close, she soon finds herself pregnant with his child. As they celebrate the announcement and preparing to make love, they are paid an unexpected visit. It is Hermann. As Bill and Hermann wrestle each other, Maria grabs a bottle and hits Bill across the head, which kills him. As the Americans put Maria on trial, Hermann takes responsibility and admits that he is the one who killed Bill. As Hermann is put in jail, Maria says that she will wait for him so that they can start a new life together. Furthermore, in spite of picturing their future with a new child, Maria tells her doctor that she is going to abort it. In the meantime, Maria focuses on attaining wealth. During a train ride, she meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny) in first class, a half-German, a half-French business who owns a factory in Germany. He has returned to restart it after enduring difficult times during the war. Changing to her more seductive dress, Maria strikes a conversation with him. However, her nonchalant and in different attitude ultimately attracts him. He also admires her firm demeanor as Maria is able to drive away a drunk and noisy American soldier from the train. As they share a car ride with Karls accountant Senkenberg (Hark Bohm), Karl decides to give her a job as his personal advisor. Later as she tells her family about her new position, Maria decides to move out of her mothers house in order to prepare for a future home with Hermann, much to the disagreement of those around her, especially Betti. Visiting Hermann in prison, she tells him that she is going to change thanks to this job. In one of her first duties as personal assistant, she becomes a translator for Karl and an English speaking customer. However, she doesn't translate faithfully in order to tell Karl what he wants to hear. As Karl and Senkenberg argue over whether or not the company can afford to buy three SE Machines, Maria asks for 30-minutes alone with the customer. In the scene that follows, Karl congratulates Maria with a toast for her contribution. However, Senkenberg remains skeptical as he would only drink in five years time of the company. As Karl reprimands Senkenberg for not being able to have fun, Maria jumps to his defense. We soon find Maria in bed with Karl. He even asks her to be with him over the weekend in the country. However, she tells him that she has to visit someone on the weekend. Maria though does not divulge the fact that she is going to visit her husband. As Karl tries to understand her and show her his affection, Maria shrugs it away. Instead, she chooses to talk about her salary as she tells him that she has to earn a lot of money over the next few years. On the day Maria visits Hermann, she tells him that she is sleeping with Karl. She reassures him that she wants to sleep with him because she is dependent on him. Furthermore, she does it in order to give herself the upper hand. Upon returning home, Maria finds Karl waiting for her. Having spent the night together, Karl lets it known that he was going to propose to her had she gone with him to the country. Maria tells him that she will never marry him, but is willing to settle as his mistress. In a business event, Maria finds out from Willy that his marriage with Betti is in trouble for he is unable to communicate with her. Willy describes her as someone who cooks for me. In the following scenes, Karl once again reiterates his love for Maria. Yet, his love remains unrequited as she simply offers her body to him. One day, Karl pays a visit to Hermann in order to meet the man that Maria loves. Karl makes a secret deal with Hermann that if he stays away from Maria until Karl dies, than they will get the company. Later, on her mothers birthday, Maria finds that her mother has a new lover. During the party, Betti reveals that she is losing Willy. Like the strong assertive woman that she is, Maria tells her that she can do something about it. As Maria dances with Karl, he declares his love, fully realizing that he is going to die soon because of his liver.
Finally on the day of Hermann's release, she realizes that he has left to Australia or Canada. As agreed upon with the deal between Hermann and Karl, Hermann will leave a rose every month for her to remember him by. Maria soon loses herself in her job. Her personality begins to transform as her once firm demeanor evolves into certain ruthlessness. Her family, co-workers, and Karl become victims to her change. As the film draws to its end, Karl passes away. Hermann finally returns back to Maria. However, upon finding out that her husband and Karl made a deal on her behind her back, she does not accept it lightly. As Maria and Hermann are in her new home, she accidently leaves the gas stove on in order to light a cigarette. As Senkenberg leaves after handing over the company to the Brauns as promised, the house explodes as Maria lights her cigarette. The film ends with Senkenberg witnessing the dead body of Maria Braun."

This corporate job, where he is paraded around on horses in electrically-lit cowboy get-ups and the publicity department makes him grow a mustache to look more like a cowboy, eventually sucks his soul away, and he takes up the bottle and often turns up drunk at events, so the publicity department tries to hide him from the media.

"The ever efficient German war machine had little trouble sweeping over Greece, yet some stubborn resistance remained active. Various civilian prisoners were thrown with the officers in Stalag VII-Z, a camp on the site of a Neptune temple under two masters: S.S. Major Volkmann (Anthony Valentine), a Nazi extremist who enjoys exercising brutality, and gentleman camp commandant, former dodgy Viennese art merchant Major Otto Hecht (Roger Moore), who definitely prefers the finer things in life, regardless of ""political correctness"". Thus, the camp, meant to send Berlin archaeological treasures, actually keeps the true treasures for his private black market trade, via Hecht's sister in Switzerland. His ""guests"", all fortunate to be spared the usual harsh treatment of prisoners, include a brilliant professor of archaeology, Professor Blake (David Niven); an Italian cook, Bruno Rotelli (Sonny Bono); two stranded American USO performers Charlie (Elliott Gould) and Dottie Del Mar (Stefanie Powers); and even an African-American POW, Nat Judson (Richard Roundtree). Hecht's hospitality seems poorly rewarded when they mount an elaborate plan to take over the camp, in league with the local Greek resistance leader Zeno (Telly Savalas), who is determined to prevent the inevitable German slaughter of villagers in reprisal. As all seem to agree upon a common goal, the priceless art treasures in the monastery on nearby Mount Athena, Hecht is persuaded to join in for a cut of the spoils, but Zeno has a military agenda, as the Allied invasion is approaching and the monastery's mountain is also the cover for a secret German rocket installation."

"1855. Edward Pierce (Sir Sean Connery), a member of London high society, is really a criminal mastermind. He is determined to steal the twenty-five thousand pounds sterling of gold shipped once a month via train by the handling bank, Huddleston and Bradford, from London to Folkestone on the coast, where it is shipped to Crimea as payment to the English troops, who, along with their French counterparts, are waging war there against Russia. There has never been a successful robbery on a moving train, which is considered folly by the authorities. Because of the nature of the safe in the luggage compartment of the train where the gold is kept, Pierce believes the easiest way into the safe is to obtain copies of the four keys required to open the safe, the four which are individually entrusted to three key people, who cannot know that copies have been made. Two are kept locked in the offices of the railway despatcher; one is kept in an unknown location by Huddleston and Bradford President, Edgar Trent (Alan Webb); and one is kept at all times around the neck of the bank branch Manager, Henry Fowler (Malcolm Terris), an acquaintance of Pierce's. Pierce needs the assistance of several people to pull off the heist, he enlisting: his beautiful mistress, Miriam (Lesley-Anne Down), who hopes the gold will mean a future for the two of them together; Robert Agar (Donald Sutherland), a screwsman; Barlow (George Downing), his chauffeur; ""Clean Willy"" (Wayne Sleep), a young cat burglar; and Burgess (Michael Elphick), the railway's security guard in the luggage compartment, who he will need to bribe to cooperate. Getting copies of the four keys is no easy task in and of itself, let alone getting the gold off the train undetected if they are able to get that far. They may have to turn to Plan Bs or Cs if they find the situation changes, and/or improvise on the spot if something doesn't work. But the large number of disparate individuals involved in the heist and the complexity of the plan may make the operation collapse under its own weight."

A very bold film that basically told the ""JFK"" story thinly disguised as having taken place not in the US."
"Perhaps the the best word one could use to describe this storyline would be ""serpentine,"" so let's dig in.
We start with an armored truck marked as belonging to the US Treasury Department. The truck is hijacked in a rather clever way, but the thieves aren't looking for the money inside; instead there's something else in there that they're after, but we're not sure what it is yet. The thieves get away and one of them meets with a man named Vince, played by Peter Falk. He gives the ill-gotten gains to Vince and tells him that he needs to pay the fee for it the next day. Vince is appalled by the short timeline but promises to work something out.
From there we meet a mild-mannered Manhattan dentist named Sheldon Kornpett (Alan Arkin). His daughter Barbara (Penny Peyser) is about two days away from getting married to Tommy Ricardo (Michael Lembeck). He and his wife Carol (Nancy Dussault) are going to meet Tommy's parents for the first time. All they know about Tommy's dad is that he's involved with international business deals somehow. Tommy and his parents show up late for the dinner...and we learn that his father is Vince. Sheldon is a little suspicious of Vince, because he's telling some weird stories about a nine-month stint in Guatemala that involves giant tsetse flies with beaks, and the Guacamole Act of 1917. At an introductory dinner in which Sheldon meets his new in-law Vince, he finds Vince suspicious; during the dinner, Vince tells a crazy story of a nine-month ""consulting"" trip to 1954 Guatemala. Vince's son and wife (Arlene Golonka) seem oblivious. At one point in the dinner Vince excuses himself to make a phone call, and he hides something in the basement. Later that night, Sheldon pleads with his daughter not to marry into the Ricardo clan, since he doesn't trust Vince, but he is talked into giving the marriage a chance.
The following day, Vince appears at Sheldon's office, claiming that he wanted to say hello. He asks Sheldon for help with a five-minute errand that involves breaking into Vince's office safe. Sheldon reluctantly agrees. After retrieving a mysterious black bag from Vince's cramped office in an old Herald Square office building, two armed hit men surprise Sheldon. After a chase down a fire escape and the ensuing shootout, Vince explains to Sheldon-in the middle of a crowded diner, no less-that he has worked for the CIA since the Eisenhower administration and robbed the United States Mint of engraving plates to crack a worldwide inflation plot hatched in Central America. He also mentions that he's gone rogue, because the CIA thought the caper was too risky and turned him down. Vince claims that Sheldon is not involved. However, if Vince is caught, he will be jailed for 20 years and fired from the CIA. Vince further upsets Sheldon by mentioning he left one of the engraving plates in the basement of Sheldon's house the previous night.
While taking a delivery of supplies for the wedding, Mrs. Kornpett discovers the engraving and brings it to her local bank, where she is informed by the U.S. Treasury Department that it was stolen. Sheldon arrives home to find vehicles from the Treasury Department parked out front, and he high-tails it out of there, leading to a car chase through suburban New Jersey. After shaking the Feds, Sheldon calls Vince and explains what happened. Vince tells Sheldon he wants him to accompany him to Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the whole ordeal will be cleared up by the time they return. At a small airport near Lodi, New Jersey, Vince and Sheldon board a private jet. We get a very funny scene aboard the plane involving one of the plane's crew, played by James Hong.
To Sheldon's dismay, during the flight he notices they are flying over the ocean. Vince assures Sheldon they are still going to Scranton, but they need to make a brief stop along the way in Tijata, a small island south of Honduras. When they arrive, Vince is supposed to meet a corrupt member of the small country's legislature, General Jesus Braunschweiger. But shortly after they land, Jesus is shot and killed before he can greet and debrief the two. Vince and Sheldon fall under sniper fire and, using the general's car, escape and drive into town. At their hotel, Sheldon, understandably tired of the ordeal, refuses to be shot at anymore. Vince agrees to leave him out of the rest of the operation. Sheldon goes to the lobby on a pretense and calls the United States Embassy to tell the story so far. Barry Lutz, the CIA agent-in-charge (Ed Begley Jr.) tells him that Vince is a madman who was mentally discharged from the agency a year earlier . Sheldon tells this to Vince, who prevents him from escaping, assuring Sheldon that the embassy told him that specifically to get Sheldon off the trail. Sheldon is still reluctant.
Leaving the hotel, Vince hails a taxi driven by one of the airport snipers. Sheldon realizes who it is and chases after it, eventually leaping onto the roof of the car. Vince takes control of the car, crashing into a fruit market. The car chase resumes, this time with Sheldon INSIDE the car.
They manage to get away and they reach the general's estate. General Garcia (Richard Libertini) gives them $20 million for the plates, awards them medals, and promptly marches them in front of a firing squad. Vince stalls for time until hundreds of CIA agents, led by Barry Lutz, overwhelm the army and take Garcia into custody. Lutz reveals that Vince was telling the truth the entire time. However, Vince suddenly announces his retirement, as he has had enough and he's looking forward to grandchildren. He gives Lutz the $10 million he had agreed to deliver from the general. The general overhears this and protests that he gave them $20 million but Vince says he's clearly crazy.

"Michael Hill has just been hired as the new reverend at North Avenue Presbyterian, he and his two adolescent children Carmel and Dean moving to New Campton, California into the house next to the church in the process. Michael finds he has many hurdles to overcome. There is a dwindling congregation, his main job to increase church membership. Anne Woods, the church secretary and daughter of the previous longtime reverend who retired, likes the way things have always been done at the church, which includes she and her father having chaired all the church committees in an ""if you want things done, do it yourself"" mentality. He finds that she is partly right in that many of the congregants, while well meaning, indeed would bungle such responsibility even if they did have an interest. In running the church, he finds that he runs into what he considers a bigger problem in the town as a whole, namely that there exists illegal gambling on a large scale by organized crime, in essence what he believes controls the town administration. After hearing Michael passionately speak, albeit impromptu in place of what was supposed to be a standard prayer, against the illegal gambling on a televised public service announcement, he gets chastised by Anne and the church presbytery for politicking. However, special investigators Marv Fogleman and Tom Voories with the Treasury Department, ask, on the sly, for Michael's help in breaking up the organized illegal gambling in New Campton, all they wanting being a few trustworthy men to make a few bets at the known bookie sites and testify as such in court. With none of the male congregants willing to get involved, Michael is only able to provide five female congregants, and one honorary ""female"" member, they a disparate bunch but eager to do their part. Despite Marv's belief that the six may be able to pull it off in the crime syndicate never suspecting a bunch of ""ditzy"" women, they instead bungle things so badly as to get Marv to the point of a nervous breakdown. With or without the Treasury Department support, Michael and his six ""operatives"" decide to aim for what will be the most damaging but most difficult aspect of the syndicate to locate and shut down, namely their ""bank"". With Michael already a known from the PSA and as the six become more and more known to the crime syndicate, their lives may be placed into jeopardy in their entirety, from their relationships to friends and family who are on a need to know basis, to their livelihoods including Michael's, to their lives. The church itself may also be placed at risk if Max Roca, the head of the syndicate, feels they as a collective are becoming too much of an irritant. Roca may not however understand the determination of the group and what is actually driving their motivation."

Franny senses the divorce because she has been secretly watching her father arrive home at 5:00 every morning and pathetically try to brush off (to his wife) and hide (from his daughter) the fact that he has been away all night. She is down in the dumps and finds a kindred spirit in her buddy Jamie, whose parents split up long ago. He points out the advantages of being a ""child of divorce"", and is so persuasive that he almost convinces himself as well as Franny. When Franny convinces her parents to let her go to a sleepover with Jamie, they explore their budding curiosity for the opposite sex. When Franny's mother finds the book ""The Joy of Sex"" in her daughter's bedroom and discovers that her daughter has deceived her, four frantic ""adult"" couples converge on the sleepover site--Jamie's father's swanky, fantastical bachelor pad--to catch the two in a compromising position. Ultimately, Jamie and Franny realize that, in order to survive the undeniable disadvantages of their parents' divorces, they must weather the hard times together as friends...if not more."

"A young offender is sent to borstal (""reform school"" in American terms) and faces the brutality and indifference of the guards. He manages to work his way to the top of the prisoner heap by his use of violence against the reigning inmates who attempt to intimidate him. The standard response to inmate-on-inmate violence when asked by the guards is ""I fell sir"" - the fear of retaliation is more compelling than any help you might or might not get from the staff. There's a really brutal and realistic rape scene in the garden shed of a younger looking inmate, while a guard looks in through the window, appearing to be enjoying the scene. When asked ""what's all this then?"" he manages to croak out the expected reply, ludicrous given the obviousness of what happened. The victim ends up killing himself as a result, sparking off a riot. another interesting inmate is the intellectual trying to fight the system in his own non-violent way, equally unsuccessfully. Frankly, there's really not a lot of plot, this movie is mostly about the characters and the conditions in places like these that appear to sadly be the same in a lot of different countries and cultures. It is reminiscent of ""Bad Boys"" starring Sean Penn that came out in the US about the same time, which had a bit more plot than this movie, but was equally bleak in it's portrayal of life inside a juvenile offenders prison/borstal/reform school."

"Etter en tid innenfor murene samles banden igjen, men denne gangen kommer det en ung og vakker sosialkurator inn i bildet. Egon forelsker seg og staker ut en ny kurs for banden - fast jobb med lønningspose som alle andre. Ansatt i et rengjøringsbyrå med statsbanken som arbeidsplass hender det selvsagt ting. En utenlandsk forbryterliga gjør et storstilt bankkupp. Misstanken faller på Olsenbanden. De redder seg unna, og opptar jakten på de virkelige forbryterne. Men Olsenbanden har et hemmelig våpen: Dynamitt-Harry."
"Det riktige store kuppet - det endelige - kuppet over alle kupp - vil gi 6 millioner i svarte penger. Og hvem kjenner til dette? Egon Olsen og politiet. Pengene er oppbevart i det mest avanserte sikkerhetsvelv som er konstruert, med elektronisk varslingssystem i forbindelse med et fryselager, voktet av profesjonelle gorillaer."
"Egon vender denne gangen tilbake fra fengslet med nøkkelen til den store fangsten. En skatt fra tyskertiden som en tysk general har stukket unna på Sørlandet i håp om å nyte sitt liv basert på gullbarrer og amerikanske dollar. Etter en del forviklinger finner banden det rette stedet, men problemene hoper seg opp - bunkeren ligger under vann og skatten er innemurt. Parallelt med dette dukker det opp et internasjonalt forbryterpar, Carina og Ricco, som også kjenner til skatten."
"Historien begynner på Kanariøyene, banden har endelig greid å komme seg til syden. Men selv der skal oppholdet betales, og når Egon gjør et lite brekk for å fikse det, blir han tatt.

"Olsenbanden har slått seg ned som multimillionærer i Spania. Den avslappede tilværelsen får imidlertid en brå slutt da superskurken Biffen får fatt i kofferten med millionene.

De tapte millionene er nemlig byttet inn i gullbarrer av de multinasjonale slynglene, og gullet må fraktes med tog. I tilegg er Dynamitt-Harry i god gammel sprengningsform."
Ved hjelp av en korrupt diplomat planlegger Olsenbanden å rane Verdensbanken. Denne gangen får de også hjelp av Dynamitt-Harry. Men denne gangen som Data-Harry. Harry sovnet en dag i en conteiner på Amerikalinjens kai - og da han voknet befant han seg i Statene. Ved underverdenes hjelp gikk han på et omskoleringskurs og er nå vendt tilbake til gamlelandet med en helt ny stil - som Data-Harry. Dette fører til at Egon Olsen og hans gamle metoder blir satt litt i skyggen. Noe som Egon selv ikke liker.
"Valborg har fått et nytt problem å stri med. Basse, hennes sønn, har ledet en ung kvinne ut i fristelsen, og nå gjelder det å redde ansikt. D.v.s. å få dem gift. Utsiktene er lyse, for Egon har fått fotfeste i de høyere sosiale kretser, eller nærmere bestemt, han skal arbeide for en baron. Det hele virker enkelt. Men de vikler seg inn i farefulle situasjoner, fra nifse opplevelser i middelalderkjellere hvor gjenferd går igjen, til tidens kupp i Nationaltheatret under det danske gjestespill ""Elverhøy""."
"Det er store penger det dreier seg om denne gang, nemlig 4 millioner lett omsettelig mynt, nemlig moms-penger. De impliserte blir i tur og orden millionærer og raka fant en rekke ganger. Banden møter kongen og knekten, den første en gammel varieteløve som nå livnærer seg av det som tilfeldigvis dukker opp i øyeblikket. Annen manns eiendom er en forslitt setning for ham. Knekten er hans kjødelige nevø, og kongen har forsøkt å oppdra ham i den rette ånd, men akk."

There are many reasons for this personal drama: the burning tears of the Revolution, the chimera of death haunting the place and, above all, the degradation of the priest who has turned from an inspired idealist into a fanatical lunatic. Befuddled by the sterile canons of his religion, Eredia sinks into the hermetic world of his lunacy and is humiliatingly detached from the sufferings of ordinary people and his own nation. Exhausted by her experiences, Fanny starts taking morphine."

""Young and Healthy Like a Rose"" is a strong visionary achievement that still looks topical today as back in the times when it was filmed and banned by the then communist censorship. A story about a young delinquent, who evolves from typical outsider to mafia boss of Belgrade seemed shocking back then; today, it is the cruel reality of our times. With incredible foresight of things to come, Jovanovic's leading character says: ""I am your future"". More poetical than Hollywood movies, much more realistic than ""Trainspotting"".

The best role of Dragan Nikolic, one of the rare ones he presented himself as a tough guy and the authentic sex symbol from this region. A slap in the face of film and other convention. A must see!"

We are there from the dawn preparations and rituals on the outskirts of Paris and through the rigours of the race with special focus on a number of prominent cyclists to the final outcome on the Roubaix cycle track - followed by the filthy riders taking their showers. There is also an eye for life among the spectators and the media event as such. The film alternates among different kinds of shot with a view to establishing the most suitable view of the narrative: shots from motorcycles, which are able to convey the motion of the race and provide close ups of the riders in the style of television cycle race reporting; fixed cameras stationed at strategically important points along the route, where viewers can watch riders passing in real time and thus gain a clear overview of the distance between the leaders and the main field: and the Olympian eye of the helicopter shots."

"Twenty-six U.S. homosexuals of various ages and backgrounds are interviewed, they who speak candidly about their sexual orientation in this era just a few years after the initial gay liberation at Stonewall. They speak of when they first knew of their sexual orientation and what that actually meant to them during a time when there were few open outlets or supports for homosexuals in U.S. society. Some speak of the added pressures if the acknowledgment of being homosexual was during one's adolescent period, when there is enough pressure from adolescence in and of itself. They also speak of the period of disclosure - for some, this process being involuntary - with many who were treated as having a mental disorder and the resulting fear or anger associated with the treatment. Into their disclosed period, they needed to figure out where in society they fit, whether it be in relation to their sweet-hearts, to friends or society in general. To each person or group, these roles could be totally different. They speculate on their future as homosexuals based on their experiences and the state of homosexual acceptance in U.S. society."

"Two concurrent stories that eventually do intersect are told. The primary story concerns a murder investigation of a bludgeoned John Doe, estimated to be in his early- to mid-sixties, the body discovered at the Kamata Rail Yard in Tokyo and moved there post-mortem to make it look like he died by being hit by a train. The investigative team includes experienced Inspector Eitaro Imanishi and novice Detective Hiroshi Yoshimura. The slim leads they have in even discovering the identity of the John Doe, let alone the murderer, stem from an overheard conversation at a local bar between the victim and the perpetrator, the men unknown to anyone in the bar, the keys to the conversation being one speaking in an accent specific to the Tohoku region, and both men often mentioning the proper name ""Kameda"". In the ebbs and flows of the investigation, and Yoshimura being taken off the case in a lull to focus on other more active cases, both investigators nonetheless end up with a dogged determination which takes mostly Imanishi to various places throughout Japan in following leads, some on his own dime in being unofficial. The investigation only becomes more confusing in discovering the identity of the victim, what the investigators are told by those that knew him being his general benevolence in all aspects of his life, and that he had no business in Tokyo. The secondary story concerns renowned up and coming composer/conductor Eiryo Waga, his fame which means that he is often surrounded by an entourage. His general sullenness may be attributed to a childhood denied, that denial of which he is the only person who knows, or so he believes."

Nearly 30 speak, describing atrocities personally committed or witnessed, telling of inaccurate body counts, and recounting the process of destroying a village. The atrocities are casual, seem routine, and are sanctioned or committed by officers. Images from the war illustrate the testimony; there's a side discussion among veterans about racism and a couple of interviews about the soldiers' self-realization. The testimony appears in the US Congressional Record on April 6 and 7, 1971. A ""winter soldier"" contrasts with Paine's ""summer soldier and sunshine patriot."""

"Before the inspector can confront Hinckus over the validity of those claims, there's an avalanche. Both the power and the phones lines are knocked out and it will take at least a week for someone to dig out the roads leading there.
Olaf is soon found dead in his room. His arm outstretched toward a briefcase and his head rather unnaturally twisted around almost completely backwards. Coinciding with the discovery of the body is the arrival of a mysterious man who just sort of turns up there out of the blue claiming to be a friend of Olaf's. He is Luarvik (Sulev Luik) and proves to be every bit as strange as the other guests when he gains consciousness, claiming that while he knows Olaf though he does not know what he looks like. He seems to be after something in his suitcase, which the inspector has hidden. Luarvik is also pallid, physically weak and needs to sleep a lot.
Glebsky begins an investigation and begins locating and questioning the hotel's guests. Though Hinckus would be high up on the suspect list, he is found knocked out and tied up to a bed. Simon is then found delirious and claiming he found and tried to get romantic with Mrs. Moses' corpse, though she is soon found still alive a short time later. Brun seems curiously unperturbed by the murder of Olaf and even jokes around about it. She does reveal that she saw Hinckus in his fur coat in the hall after 10:00 p.m. A strange contraption is found among Olaf's belongings that Simon hypothesizes is either from the military or outer space. When Hinckus is confronted, he tells Glebsky that he was knocked out and tied up by what he observed as himself. At this point, the murder investigation of Olaf comes to a standstill. Glebsky says his only mistake at this point was not sensing the danger he was in.
Mr. Moses is incensed that his wife was awakened in about all the events that night and that his wife will be questioned by the inspector. When Glebsky enters the Moses's suite, he learns that Mrs. Moses saw Olaf and Brun hand in hand like lovers in the hallway. Glebsky returns to Brun and tells her that she was the last person to see Olaf alive. Brun intimates the details of how she and Olaf were kissing when the avalanche struck. Alex keeps casually bringing up things like aliens and zombies which Alex claims are ""the third state of living organisms"". Glebsky falls asleep and dreams he skis off a high ledge.
Glebsky is awakened by Lel's discovery of a gun in the snow that was likely thrown from the roof. Glebsky reasons that Hinckus was indeed stalking someone. Luarvik has again regained consciousness. Glebsky tries to question the self-described foreigner but with little success. At one point, Glebsky dismisses Mr. Moses from entering the room. Luarvik wants to talk with Olaf even after Glebsky reveals that Olaf has been murdered. Luarvik seems to be searching for something and Glebsky reasons it is the briefcase he confiscated. Luarvik is relieved that Glebsky has it. Luarvik does not understand the need to answer Glebsky's many questions. Finally, Luarvik is weakened and needs rest.
Glebsky begins to conclude that Olaf, Luarvik and Mr. Moses belong to the same gang and do not want that information to be public. Hinckus may have been a rival. Glebsky then states that it may have been a mistake not to associate Moses or Luarvik with Olaf's murder and holding HInckus may be a mistake. He instructs Alex Snewahr to see that everyone is at breakfast the next morning.
Dawn breaks. At breakfast, Glebsky tells those gathered that they are cut off from the outside world but he has sent a message to local police by carrier pigeon that a police helicopter would soon arrive as a ploy to see who would react. After breakfast, Glebsky detains Hinckus calling him the Owl. A physical altercation results in Hinckus injuring Glebsky's arm but is knock unconscious by Simonet's pool cue. HInckus eventually confesses that he is a member of a hit squad sent by the Boss to take out ""The Master"" who pulled a major bank heist but seemed to operate differently than other criminals with his unwillingness to kill hostages. When he completely stopped working with Hinckus's associates, Hinckus was sent to find him. Hinckus insists that a helicopter will soon be arriving and the Boss is coming with three associates to finish the job on Mr. Moses.
Glebsky fails to realize there are forces at work in the realm of the supernatural. Simonet explains that Moses is an alien, sent to observe but made the mistake of interacting with humans and he got caught up working with terrorists who robbed the Second National Bank but are now set on killing him. Luarvik is the space ship pilot who is slowly dying. Olaf and Mrs. Moses are their robots, though they are quite human like. They died when the avalanche hit and the power failed by are brought back to life by backup battery supplies. The four are seeking to escape and return to their planet.
Upon this revelation, Glebsky struggles to believe what he is observing. He struggles with the mindset created by over 40 years of police work based on reason and logic and accepting possibilities that are far beyond his experience. Ultimately, Glebsky decides that Moses has broken the law in the National Bank heist and should be arrested and taken to trial. Burn and Simonet advocate on behalf of the aliens.
Alex and Simon wrestle with the injured Glebsky and a sympathetic Snewahr reclaims the suitcase from its hiding place. Olaf is brought back to life. The quartet of aliens make their break skiing toward the mountains to avoid being hunted by a helicopter that is either gangsters arriving to finish the job, or the government coming to eradicate evidence of an alien encounter. In the mountains the aliens suffer a calamity when they are decimated by rocket releases from the helicopter and killed. The inspector had a chance to do great service to the aliens, but Glebsky behaves like a typical cop, subordinate only to common sense and official instructions which leads to the tragic outcome. He says if they were merely thieves, they got what they deserved, but if they were not of this world, logically there is no reason to care about them. As he explains to the audience in a sepia-toned, on-camera coda, he makes no apologies for how he handled the strange events during his stay, but he does not back down from believing the entire murder plot was tied to something less earthbound. Still, the inspector is plagued by doubts whether he did everything he could. ***"
"Under the Turks' heavy thumb and the Ottomans' reign of terror in early-1820s Greece, the son of a klepht, fervent patriot and cleric, Gregorius Dikaeos Flessas, or Papaflessas, was the selfless revolutionary--who, in complete disregard for his own life--was arming the enslaved Greek ""ragiades"" with the will to fight for the cherished and long-awaited freedom. Ordained to the highest rank in the clergy, that of Archimandritis, Papaflessas was able to move freely in the region of Moldovlachia--and as a member of the secret organisation, Filiki Eteria--he played a key role in preparing the ground for a nation's imminent uprising to gain its independence. From the commencement of the revolution on March 25, 1821, to his heroic fall on May 20, 1825, in the Battle of Maniaki against Ibrahim Pasha's brutal multitudes, Papaflessas will always be remembered as a hero in the everlasting pantheon of Greece's immortals."
"A boy from a poor Sofia neighborhood - Rado who is orphan and has committed several petty crimes - is sent to a borstal, or, to put it otherwise becomes a juvenile prisoner. Unfortunately, however, he cannot reconcile his uncomplicated pride, sense of justice with the kind of education provided by people who are more often than not deprived of sensibility and human warmth. The order there is repulsive, the boy is seeking for freedom and often makes escapes. During one of the escapes he meets the love of his lifetime. Suddenly Rado falls in love with Benny, a student, the daughter of well educated and sophisticated family (at least, this is the first impression) and this intensify his desire for freedom and independence. Naturally, conflict is not slow to appear. The parents of Benny are panic-stricken when getting aware of the fact. They are resolved to separate the couple. Their parental love is sincere but the reality is phony and cruel. The boy's hopes are thwarted for good and vacuity reigns in the mind of the girl. Dead set on putting an end to the 'unequal' union, Benny's mother forces the girl to have an abortion. The fruit of a 'reckless' love is killed and the first genuinely powerful feelings between two young people betrayed. The makers of this dramatic and moving film (also remarkable for the superb performance of the actors) denounce the old-fashioned social prejudices and present lobe and faith in man as scared symbols, which everyone should treasure."

But, as one thing leads to another, Rena will have to resort to a desperate, last-gasp plan; a terrible decision with dire consequences, as the siblings, along with Vagelis' sweetheart, Maria, all end up in the unforgiving deserts of distant Anatolia, and the dank dungeons of the Arab Sheikh, Muhammad Abdullah.
