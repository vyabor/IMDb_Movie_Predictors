"A profile of Anton LaVey and the Satanic Church that he founded in San Francisco is presented through interviews - with Le Vay himself, congregants including his current (second) wife, Christian religious leaders and people who live in the neighborhood of the church - and sequences of church services.

The congregants talk about what attracted them to the church, with a small subset talking about the connection to witchcraft. Religious leaders and Joe and Jane Public talk about what they can see of the church from the outside, including if what Le Vay has created is truly religion and a church.

Less than twenty-four hours after its activation, it finds a similar system in the USSR, called Guardian, designed by Doctor Kuprin. At the request of both machines, they are linked. Colossus and Guardian proceed to exchange information at an incredibly fast rate, such that it alarms the President, and he orders a disconnection.

As Gérard goes through this process, working hard to stay true to his beliefs, Lise, who believes he will soon be released if he cooperates with the Communists, is being told other things about his incarceration."

"Outlaw Luther Sledge and sidekick Mallory pull into the town of 3 W for an overnight stay.

The next day, Sledge leaves town to meet with the rest of his gang in the hills. He notices the old man from the saloon following him on horseback some distance away. Sledge stops the old man and asks him why he is following behind. The old man explains that he is not following Sledge but rather a convoy escorting a gold shipment. Interested, Sledge takes him at the meeting with his gang. There, the old man explains that while serving a 20 year sentence in the Rockville maximum security prison he learned about the existence of a vault inside the prison where gold is kept overnight. The gold mines in the region ship their gold under heavy armed escort to the prison where the gold sits in the vault overnight until ready to be taken to the gold exchange in the city. The escort is comprised of 40 hand-picked armed guards and the gold wagon is equipped with a manned machine-gun on top of it. Attacking the convoy would surely mean suicide. The old man insists his story is true and that he was imprisoned in a cell adjacent to the bank-like vault deep inside the prison. Only six inches of steel separated him from the gold kept in the vault. At this point, Sledge realizes that attacking the gold shipment and its escort wouldn't be feasible. However, the old man's story gives him the idea of breaking into the vault inside the prison where the gold is stored overnight before being taken to the city. Sledge shares his plan with his gang and reveals his plan to pose as a prisoner in transit being escorted by a marshal to the Rockville prison for an overnight stay until the next day when the marshal would take him to the jurisdiction that posted the wanted bond for Sledge. A member of the gang, Erwin Ward, agrees to impersonate the marshal and Sledge agrees to play the captured outlaw and use his real name since he's wanted for a 5000 dollars reward anyway. Will the plan work ?"

Filmed provocatively in 16mm and with sound negative, the tensions between black and white favor the strange ""fantasmatic materialism"" of this revealing analysis of the construction mechanism for the magic in dominant narrative cinema, which at the same time constitutes a radical intervention in the Spanish cinematographic institution."

What possessions of hers that were not repossessed by creditors were destroyed in the demolition. Bunny feels she cannot ask her adult children, Ad and Lulu, for help, as they depend on her. In reality, Ad and Lulu are ungrateful and selfish, wallowing in financial holes of their own making.

"Merwin Wren, the longtime PR head at Valiant Tobacco, comes up with an idea in his desire to have company figurehead Hiram C. Grayson be known in the same vein as Alfred Nobel as opposed to the man who sold 13 trillion cancer causing cigarettes (who remembers that Nobel was a munitions manufacturer, he who used only a small fraction of his wealth to hand out a Peace Prize?): give $25 million to any town in America that will give up smoking for thirty days. After the laughter from the company executives subsides in the ridiculousness of the scheme, Wren convinces them that no town can meet the eligibility criteria of one hundred percent of its citizens signing up, and even in the remote possibility that any one does, that not all one hundred percent would be able to go cold turkey for thirty days, meaning that this PR stunt to raise Grayson to immortality would cost them virtually nothing. By the entry deadline, one town to Wren's amazement meets the sign up criteria: Eagle Rock, Iowa. It is a town with a population 4,006 and declining as one business and industry after another is leaving town and with them its citizens in it being a depressed town. Rev. Clayton Brooks was the one who spearheaded the initiative in his own self-motivated goal of raising the town's fortunes so that he will be reassigned to the town and church of his choice, preferably more prosperous ones. He was able to convince everyone in town, using one tactic or another, to sign up, even the large percentage of die hard smokers, the toughest case being Dr. Proctor, the town's surgeon. Beyond everyone needing to go cold turkey for the thirty days, the contest brings up some systemic problems within the community, both as a collective and individually. In the latter category is Rev. Brooks' own failings as a husband to his repressed wife, Natalie. Conversely, as there is the possibility that Eagle Rock may actually win the $25 million, Wren takes it upon himself to ensure that it doesn't happen."

"In 1971, Peter Bogdanovich was, perhaps, America's most promising young filmmaker, having directed the remarkable ""Targets"" (1968) and ""The Last Picture Show"" (1971) earning him an Academy Award nomination for the latter. At this point, he chose to make a documentary about legendary film director John Ford. The result was a documentary that drew excellent reviews, following a screening at the 1971 New York Film Festival and a television broadcast. It was later withdrawn from circulation because of legal rights. It was only in early 2006 that Bogdanovich - who was reportedly never totally happy with the 1971 version - went back and revamped the documentary to his satisfaction. He recorded totally new interviews with Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg and incorporated a rare audio recording of Ford and his rumored 'significant other' Katharine Hepburn. He has integrated these new elements alongside the strongest sections from the first version - including extended interviews with Ford and collaborators such as John Wayne, Richard Widmark, James Stewart and Henry Fonda. The result is an entertaining, comprehensive and loving tribute to the man long regarded as one of America's greatest film directors.

"It's pre-revolutionary Russia in the largely Jewish community of Anatevka, Ukraine, whose residents are ruled by community and cultural traditions. For poor dairy farmer, Tevye, and his wife, Golde, those traditions include getting the town matchmaker, Yente, to find their five daughters - the three oldest, Tzeitel, Hodel and Chava, who are barely of marrying age - suitable wealthy husbands, especially important since the girls will have no dowries. Tzeitel, not yet twenty, doesn't like that Yente only chooses old men. She is also in love with the poor tailor, Motel. Motel doesn't believe Tevye would approve of a union between himself and Tzeitel because of Motel's poor socioeconomic state, and without someone arranging the union. Hodel understands these traditions better than her elder sister, Hodel who has her sights on the rabbi's son, because of what he is, not because of who he is. Chava accepts her fate, marriage still being years away, but she hopes for someone she will love while she now focuses on her love of books. Change from those traditions is in the air, which is confirmed by Perchik, a young man, a student espousing Marxist ideals, recently arrived from Kiev.

Dreaming of living with Granny, the children decide to run away to Galway County to be with her. The start of their journey is before they are able to discover that they are heirs to an estate, that substantial amount of money which will otherwise go to their maternal Uncle John Cyril Dove - an actor with the stage name Hawk Dove due to the hawk tattooed on his right inner wrist - if the children cannot be found. Learning that he will control the money until the children reach an age of majority, Uncle Toby enlists the assistance of a detective to get the children back, he in turn offering a small fraction of the inheritance as a reward. As mean as Uncle Toby is, Uncle Hawk is even worse as he is willing to kill the children to get the inheritance if he can find them. What is working in Uncle Hawk's favor is that he, as an actor, is a master of disguise, the only thing that may give him away under any of those disguises being the tattoo. Through it all, Granny hopes and prays the children make it to her loving home. The children get into one misadventure after another as they try to make their way Granny, while trying to evade the police, Uncle Toby and his detective, and Uncle Hawk.

Beyond a demonstration outside the hospital in protest to they developing an adjacent property, the demonstration with which the frazzled Chief of Administrative, Dr. John Sundstrom, will primarily have to deal, a young resident Dr. Howard Schaefer has been discovered dead in one of the hospital beds, in what at first glance looks to be a case of malpractice of the hospital.

But as more medical staff are found dead around the hospital by unusual circumstances, there may more at play this day than initially thought. Through all this chaos, Bock may find some meaning in life in dealing with the case of patient Edward Drummond, who came into the hospital a relatively healthy man, but who has fallen into a coma the result of that staff mismanagement/incompetence.

The only lead is a typewritten obscene letter Tom purportedly wrote to Manhattan actress/model/call girl Bree Daniel, who admits to having received such letters from someone, and since having received several mysterious telephone calls as well.

"The film covers the last 15 years in the lives of Nicholas (Michael Jayston) and Alexandra (Janet Suzman), the last Czar and Czarina of Russia, and their family. The story starts in 1904 with the birth of Alexei, the last of five children and the only son, who Nicholas and Alexandra see as the continuation of the 300-year-old Romanov dynasty. Global forces seem to be shifting, which threatens that dynasty. Other countries, such as Britain, have a monarchy that is largely symbolic, where the key decisions are made by an elected parliament, unlike the Russian duma, which is under Nicholas' control. Many of Nicholas' decisions have led to poverty and starvation amongst the Russian populace, especially among the working and peasant classes. Those unpopular decisions include the unnecessary war with Japan over Korea; Nicholas wanted an ice-free port in the Pacific, at the price of Russian lives. Many of these decisions are also against the advice of his inner circle of government ministers. There is an uprising of the working class, and Vladimir Lenin (Michael Bryant) has formed the Bolshevik Party under Marxist ideals. Government actions against the working class, sanctioned by Nicholas or not, lead to greater public dissatisfaction with his rule. But the greatest threat to the Romanov dynasty may be Alexandra. Her unpopularity grows through her association with Siberian peasant and self-professed holy man Grigori Rasputin (Tom Baker), who states that he is the voice of God. Alexandra, a highly devout woman, is grasping at anything that will keep hemophiliac Alexei alive. She sees her faith in Father Grigori as the only reason Alexei has survived as long as he has. Her unpopularity increases even more with the onset of World War I, as Russia is at war with Germany and she is from a German background."

"""Punishment Park"" is a pseudo-documentary purporting to be a film crews's news coverage of the team of soldiers escorting a group of hippies, draft dodgers, and anti-establishment types across the desert in a type of capture the flag game. The soldiers vow not to interfere with the rebels' progress and merely shepherd them along to their destination. At that point, having obtained their goal, they will be released. The film crew's coverage is meant to insure that the military's intentions are honorable. As the representatives of the 60's counter-culture get nearer to passing this arbitrary test, the soldiers become increasingly hostile, attempting to force the hippies out of their pacifist behavior. A lot of this film appears improvised and in several scenes real tempers seem to flare as some of the ""acting"" got overaggressive. This is a interesting exercise in situational ethics. The cinéma vérité style, hand-held camera, and ambiguous demands of the director - would the actors be able to maintain their roles given the hazing they were taking - pushed some to the brink. The cast's emotions are clearly on the surface. Unfortunately this film has gone completely underground and is next to impossible to find. It would offer a captivating document of the distrust that existed between soldiers willfully serving in the military and those persons who opposed the war peacefully."

"John Shaft is a black private detective working in downtown New York City. He learns the hard way that Bumpy Jonas, a Harlem-based black mobster, wants to hire him to locate his daughter, Marcy Jonas, who Bumpy claims was kidnapped, there being no ransom note. All Bumpy can tell Shaft is that he believes that a mid-level Harlem black thug named Ben Buford, who is known now to be laying low, is either behind or knows something about the kidnapping. Because of his criminal history, Bumpy can't go to the police for their help, and he chose Shaft because he has his hands on the pulse of both the black and white communities in inner city New York. Despite not liking the way that Bumpy contacted him, Shaft agrees to the job in part because he can see that Bumpy has true concern for his daughter, a probable innocent in the matter. Even before having the conversation with Bumpy, Shaft is contacted by NYPD Lieutenant Vic Androzzi - the two having a love/hate relationship with each other - who wants Shaft to tell him what he knows about what's going on with Bumpy if only to prepare for any potential bloodshed that might be going down down the pipe. As Shaft knows Vic isn't being totally forthright with him, he has to decide how much of what he knows he will divulge to Vic as the case progresses. As Shaft progresses with the case, following the only leads of Marcy's last known whereabouts and trails to Buford's current hiding place, Shaft will learn why Bumpy believes Buford is involved. Ultimately, Shaft gets caught in the middle in a war of Bumpy's mob gang and the Italian mafia. To keep himself safe while locating and rescuing Marcy, Shaft knows he needs more muscle, amassing such a gang to do what would be less than legal actions may be problematic."

"It's 1870 in the American west. Outlaw Link Stuart and his bandits, which includes a suave Frenchman nicknamed Gauche, proceed to rob a train, taking the valuables from the passengers and looting the cargo. One of the passengers is the Japanese ambassador traveling to Washington to meet President Ulysses S. Grant , the Ambassador and his security detail of two samurai who are in their own private car. As such, one of the unexpected treasures the bandits is able to obtain is a ceremonial Japanese sword which was meant as a gift from the Japanese government to the President. But in the bandits' getaway, Link is double crossed by Gauche, who mistakenly assumes Link is killed in the ensuing melee. So Gauche now becomes the common enemy for both Link and the Ambassador, who is able to convince a reluctant Link to allow one of his samurai, Kuroda Jubie, to accompany him to locate Gauche and the loot. Although Gauche is a common enemy, the missions for Link and Kuroda are somewhat incompatible, as Link knows the samurai solely wants to kill Gauche to retrieve the sword, while Link has to get the information of the location of the loot from Gauche before he is killed. Also Link and Kuroda are working on different motives and different sensibilities, Link's motive which is largely monetary, while Kuroda's is solely honor, not being able to retrieve the sword which would mean dishonor and needing to go through the ritual of harakiri for eternal redemption. Although Kuroda is more than capable of taking care of himself, perhaps even more so than Link, he is still a fish out of water, and requires Link's knowledge of Gauche and the region to find him. Part of that knowledge is Cristina, Gauche's prostitute girlfriend who they may need to turn to find him. Beyond finding Gauche and trying to overcome their own differences, Link and Kuroda may have other natural obstacles of the region, namely other enemies not yet in the picture such as other bandits or marauding Comanches."

"The rarely seen Designated Victim is a true high point in 70s Italian thriller cinema, this inspired remake of Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train from director Maurizio Lucidi is able to push the concept of the original movie into something far more unbearably tense and deliciously twisted.

A chance meeting with a wealthy Count Matteo ( Pierre Clémenti ) leads to an extraordinary plan where both will do each other a murderous favor to free them from the people who ail them. The problem is Stefano treats this as a joke whilst Matteo is deadly serious and what he does drives Stefano to the edge of sanity in a gripping race against time. Shot in a mist-wreathed eerily beautiful Venice this near dream-like melding of thriller with baroque giallo overtones has remained until its home video re-release in 2008 a criminally hidden psychological gem."

Adams knows that much of the debate is against him as a person, many who see him as being obnoxious and a blow-hard.

On June 7, 1776, Adams gets Virginia Congressman Richard Henry Lee to propose a motion in Congress to debate the issue, which finally passes. However when the vote for independence finally looks like it will pass, its chief opponent, Pennsylvania Congressman John Dickinson, manages to pass a motion that any vote for independence needs to be unanimous.

Even before their overtly criminal activities, they riled the police, who harassed them for riding the rails and for Bill's ""Bolshevik"" talk. But they also rile a railway owner named Sartoris and the sadistic McIver brothers, who work as henchmen for both the authorities and Sartoris, as Bill's pro-union/pro-striking diatribes are generally against the railroad. Hence, the battle between Sartoris/the McIvers and the foursome becomes a personal one on both sides."

Defeated, grim Boleslaw wants nothing to do with the rest of the world; however, the sudden arrival of his ailing but blissful brother, Stanislaw, ratchets up the tension, triggering bitter resentment among siblings.

"After the American Civil War, many freed slaves head out West in search of free land and a better life. Former slave and Union Army sergeant Buck becomes a self-employed wagon master to wagon trains of freed slaves heading West. Buck knows the region well and he charges fair wages from the wagon trains employing him. He also has a working relationship with the local Indian tribes that charge trespassing fees from the wagon trains heading West across Indian lands. In return, they allow the settlers to move across Indian territory unhindered and to hunt a few buffalo needed to feed the wagon train settlers. However, not everyone in the region is friendly toward the black settlers traveling West. Owners of Southern plantations, dismayed by the loss of slave manpower that previously worked the plantations for free, hire band of white rogues and outlaws to prevent former black slaves from going West. In order to achieve this aim, the hired bands of rogues attack wagon trains and destroy the wagons, the supplies and the food resources of the former slaves. They threaten the black settlers with harm and they tell them to return to the Southern states where they came from and work the plantations. Wagon master Buck encourages the freed slaves to continue their trek westward and to not give up their dream of settling in the West. Knowing this, the band of rogues led by DeShay plans to capture and kill Buck. The DeShay gang sets up ambushes and traps but Buck always manages to avoid capture. The gang resides in the town of Copper Springs where the sheriff, an honest man, doesn't agree with the gang's ruthless tactics against wagon trains of freed slaves. Chased by the DeShay bunch, wagon master Buck and his tired horse arrive at a river where a black preacher, Reverend Willis Oakes Rutherford, is bathing. A desperate Buck switches horses with the preacher, against the man's will, and rides off to meet his wagon train. The preacher heads to Copper Springs where he bumps into DeShay's gang. Recognising Buck's horse, the gang interrogates the preacher about Buck's whereabouts. DeShay promises a 500 dollar reward to the preacher if the preacher finds Buck and captures or kills him. DeShay also instructs the preacher to convince all black settlers to turn back east toward the Southern plantations and abandon their trek Westward. The preacher agrees with DeShay and leaves town. Outside town he meets a wagon train formed of freed slaves and led by none other than Buck. After an angry exchange between the preacher and Buck, the preacher joins the wagon train. During the following days of travel, the preacher notices that all the money of the wagon train is kept in a money belt carried by one of the women around her waist. A few days later, a distrustful Buck orders the preacher to leave the wagon train and he himself rides away to scout the area and to pay in cash a right of passage to the local Indian tribe in behalf of the trespassing wagon train. The preacher follows Buck and he witnesses the payment made by Buck to the Indian chief for safe passage of the settlers. When Buck, followed by the preacher, returns to the wagon train, a gruesome scene awaits. DeShay's gang attacked the wagon train, stole the settlers' money, destroyed their food and supplies and even killed a few settlers. Heartbroken, the surviving settlers want to turn back but Buck encourages them to go on. Angry at the devastation, Buck and the preacher decide to ride to the town of Copper Springs and exact revenge on DeShay's gang and also try to retrieve the money DeShay stole from the black settlers. There only are two against many but Buck and the preacher are determined to do it."

"Handsome Bill McKay is not his father's son, his father being former California Governor, John J. McKay. An idealistic civil rights lawyer, Bill believes the political process is all style over substance, and thus he can accomplish more for the people, many of those disenfranchised, in his role as lawyer than politician. For the upcoming midterm election, Bill is approached by strategist Marvin Lucas to contest the Democratic nomination for the California senate seat, the actual election against wildly popular Republican incumbent, Crocker Jarmon. Marvin is able to sell Bill, with his supportive wife Nancy at his side, on the idea as he can easily win the nomination, but has no chance of winning the actual election against Jarmon and thus he can freely speak his mind to the California electorate. Bill's biggest condition is that his father not be involved at all, Bill not wanting his father's legacy to overshadow any of his own messages. Unfortunately for Bill, McKay Sr. may influence Bill's campaign whether or not he is directly involved. What Bill did not account for is that he has to make a credible showing or else his own reputation as a human being may be in jeopardy. So as the polls continually change for the good or bad for Bill, he may buckle under the pressure to become what he didn't want to be in the first place. His entire life, including his marriage, may also be totally taken over by the campaign process until election day."

"Long before faith-based films became a regular feature of mainstream movie theaters, there was, The Cross and The Switchblade. The film was made squarely within the Hollywood system yet, was set apart by the unashamedly Christian vision of its producers. It went on to become a worldwide ministry phenomenon and it stands among the early sparks that ignited today's growing Christian film movement. Based on the 1963 autobiography, of the same name by David Wilkerson, the film depicts the unlikely efforts of a ""skinny country preacher"" to bring change to the desperate lives of gang members living and dying on the mean streets of New York City. Among those whose lives were transformed was the notorious gang-leader Nicky Cruz who went on to lead a decades long outreach to gang members and other distressed young people. Wilkerson's mission to tell lost and hurting young people that there was a better way through Jesus Christ, blossomed into the Times Square Church and the international ministry of World Challenge whose mission is to bring lasting, holistic change to individuals and communities. Although this 1970 film bears the style of a different era, the life-changing solution that David Wilkerson brought to desperate lives remains forever relevant. And fifty years later, the film, for all its retro elements, still stands up to scrutiny as a well-written, stylishly produced movie featuring sincerely passionate performances. The story lives on in the book, in this film but more importantly in the legacy of lives transformed by the message that no one is ever so far gone that they cannot find the way home."

This phase of their story begins where their saga in Utvandrarna (1971) left off, in the fall of 1850, having just arrived in Minnesota from their native Sweden to begin what they hope will be a better life. They left Sweden because of the harsh and worsening conditions of their farm life, and chose Minnesota based on the stories of many of their Swedish friends who emigrated there before them. While Karl-Oskar goes through the process of setting up their homestead, eighteen year old Robert already has bigger dreams of striking it big in the California gold rush, something he is reluctant to tell Karl-Oskar until he is ready to leave if only having been under Karl-Oskar's guardianship and Karl-Oskar perhaps thinking him too young, impulsive and thus foolish. His plan is to go with his best friend Arvid, the two of them who would take the steamship down the river to St. Louis, from where they would walk the rest of the way. Also reluctant to say anything is Kristina, who can't help believe they made a mistake in leaving Sweden and their known life. Karl-Oskar and Kristina go through a series of highs and lows in their new life, some related specifically to being in Minnesota at this point in time, such as dealing with Indians and the imminent Civil War, and not knowing the language, and some related to their general life regardless of location, including Kristina's feeling of her role in the family.

"Zoologist and behavioral psychologist Dr. Jake Terrell and his team, which includes his wife, Maggie Anderson Terrell, are funded by the Franklin Foundation to conduct research with dolphins, namely to learn why they do the things they do. Their primary subject is a dolphin named Alpha - Pha for short - who was born at their research facility four years ago, and who the team raised after Pha's mother died. What Harold DeMilo, Jake's primary liaison at the Foundation, is unaware of, as is the rest of the world, but what Jake eventually divulges to DeMilo when he threatens to pull funding, is that Jake and Maggie's primary work is teaching Pha how to communicate in English. DeMilo vows to keep this information confidential as the Terrells are afraid of the outside world trying to exploit Pha. This work has stalled of late, with Pha refusing to speak, they believe because he has reached his sexual maturity. As such, they introduce a female dolphin named Beta, or Bea for short, to the research. It does more than the trick as Pha not only begins to communicate in English again, but also teaches Bea. Much to Jake's chagrin, DeMilo sends an ""old friend"" named Curtis Mahoney to the facility for a tour. What Jake and the team is unaware of is that Mahoney, who is not an old friend, blackmailed DeMilo to gain access. The team learns from DeMilo that Mahoney, out of that tour, is aware of the research and is threatening to go public. The Terrells figure they have to take preemptive action. However, what is happening with Mahoney is not all it appears on the surface, and involves a plot, indeed exploiting the dolphins, for a much more nefarious reason. When the Terrells learn what is happening, they not only try to foil the plot, but also have to make the difficult decision of what to do with Pha and Bea, which in turn may risk their research."

The donors mostly are rich black supporters of Congressman Aubrey Hale Clayton who intends to run for state governorship. After the armed robbery, the criminals disappear in a white getaway van. The police arrives at the scene but no one has any description of the suspects. Some speculate that white men committed the crime in order to sabotage the election efforts of a black candidate but others suggest it was black-on-black crime.

"The tension between a lonely policemen and the journeymen of the counter culture provides the subtext, and the stunning martian look of the Arizona mesa the backdrop, of a brilliant and influential debut feature by musician James William Guercio; the film is the missing link between The Searchers and No Country for Old Men. John Wintergreen is a diminutive motorcycle cop working the lonely highways of Arizona in the mid seventies. He works alone, but occasionally hooks up with his pal ""Zipper."" Wintergreen is conscientious and friendly, whereas Zipper is bored and argumentative, often holing up off the highway to read comic books rather than out on the road . Wintergreen is a Native American and has ambitions to be a detective. So when Zipper and Wintergreen find a delirious and disoriented elderly man wandering in the desert, the trail of how he got there leads back to a deserted shack. Inside is the body of a man who has committed suicide with a shotgun. Wintergreen airs his suspicions about the death, first to the coroner who is keen not to get involved, and then to Harve Poole, an Arizona detective. Harve believes John Wintergreen's suspicions are right and takes him under his wing as his driver and protege. This seems like the break Wintergreen needs to leave the big Harley police bike behind and to walk tall as a detective, in fresh duds, boots and a stetson, dispensing wisdom. But tensions between the two mount over cocktail waitress Jolene, and in differences of opinion over the murder, especially over some missing money, some hidden drugs and the suspected involvement of outlaw hippy bikers, whom Harve is keen to bust. Wintergreen's own run-ins with the hippies on their way to and from California were mostly friendly. Some of his colleagues in the Highway Patrol, however, believe they are in a running battle with disrespectful, drug running, proto-terrorists. John is caught in the nexus of his loyalty to the police force, his ambitions to be detective, his companion'ss distrust of the hippies, Harve's domineering style, Zipper's recidivism, Jolene's manipulation, his sense of responsibility and his own easygoing natural empathy with the people he meets.

The war had a profound effect on beekeeper and amateur mycologist Fernando, his younger wife Teresa and their two adolescent daughters Isabel and Ana.

The movie leaves a lasting impression on seven year old Ana, who is moved especially by the friendship between the monster and the little girl and the result of that friendship.

"Using on-the-record facts as the framework, a fictional account of an organized plot that led to the actual assassination of President John F. Kennedy is presented. It's late spring 1963. Harold Ferguson, a wealthy right wing American businessman, laments the possibility of liberally-minded Kennedy's reelection in 1964. As such, he has convened a small group of like minded individuals to devise a strategy for Kennedy not to be reelected. Among the group, the chief strategist is James Farrington, who has done similar work for Ferguson before. Farrington's idea: kill the President sometime before the election. His plan would have the starting point of past assassinations and assassination attempts of Presidents as its basis, all those precedents which were carried out by a lone citizen standing on his own principle, and without experience in military or revolutionary strategy. The plot would be meticulously thought out, but on the surface be made to look like a lone crazed gunman carried out the assassination on his own, that patsy of a person chosen ultimately being a Communist sympathizer named Lee Harvey Oswald who would have no idea of the actual plot. The one person who needs to be convinced is Ferguson as the sole financier, he who is an easy sell, admitting that he has authorized homicide in the past to achieve his business goals. As the plot goes into motion, they must ultimately sit back and watch it unfold to see if it happens the way Farrington believes this foolproof plan will unfold."
"Separated from her actor husband, Hollywood actress Chris MacNeil and her preteen daughter Regan are in Washington DC, where Chris is on an extended location shoot for a movie called ""Crash Course"". They have rented a brownstone in Georgetown as a place to live during the shoot, after which Chris plans to take Regan to Europe until their new house in Los Angeles is constructed. Chris continually hears noises in the middle of the night emanating from the attic, which she assumes is nothing more than a small infestation of rats. Concurrently, Regan, who had been an even keeled child, is showing periodic signs of unusual behavior, such as hyperactivity, swearing, lying and lack of concentration. The GP, Dr. Klein, who can only surmise the symptoms are a manifestation of stress from the separation and temporary move to DC away from her home, diagnoses her condition, solely based on the symptoms, as hyperkinesia. Despite Dr. Klein and other physicians trying to determine and explain Regan's increasingly abnormal and bizarre behavior with scientific theories, Chris begins to believe that there is more at play, especially as Regan's behavior ultimately includes violence and acts of superhuman strength, which can only be classified as other worldly which Regan herself could not have directly caused on her own, such as the rat-less noises in the attic. Despite having no religious convictions, Chris is convinced that since there is some other worldly force overtaking Regan, a course of action is to have that force - the demon - exorcised from Regan's being. Who contacts her is Father Damien Karras - also an M.D. who acts as a psychiatric counselor for the Catholic church - who Chris for whatever reason had been drawn to as a person she has seen in the neighborhood. Father Karras is facing his own crisis of faith upon the recent death of his mother. He needs not only the permission of the church to proceed but also his own faith that whatever he does will help as opposed to hurt Regan. Who the church also sends is Father Lankester Merrin, who may have a better understanding of what has possessed Regan and why it has chosen her, which is necessary to be able to combat it. The questions become whether Fathers Merrin and Karras have a strong enough faith to exorcise the demon and what they are willing to do to achieve their mission."

Ann's uptight attitude seems to have softened slightly ever since returning from a trip to Greece with Maud. What she has not told anyone is that her softened attitude is from a romantic one night only liaison with a young American man she met by happenstance by an out of the way Greek beach, he who tried to get her to be more carefree, if only for that one night. Purely by coincidence, she meets that man again in New York. He is twenty-two year old Peter Latham, a steel heir who is an acquaintance of Trina's. While Ann's family and friends encourage her to pursue a relationship with a wealthy southern gentleman client named J.D. Rogers, Peter pursues Ann behind the scenes, while Maud believes Peter wants to court Trina. Peter is falling in love with Ann. Although she admits she is flattered by Peter's declaration, Ann may not be able to get over the difference in their ages, regardless of what she may be feeling about him.

Dealing with an issue with Trina, discussing Billy's own life with him, and meeting Peter's friends and family may give Ann some insight into the matter."

"On his deathbed Tudor-king Henry VIII remembers his long reign and especially the crucial part his six marriages played in it, without producing the male heir he desired most to prevent civil wars for the succession as England suffered before his father's ascent.

When she too failed to produce a male heir, just princess Elisabeth, he had her head roll for 'infidelity'. The third queen, gentle Jane Seymour, died giving birth to sickly prince Edward. For diplomatic reasons Henry married minor princess Anne of Cleves, whose utter lack of female charms causes another annulment and the fall of Thomas Cromwell, who recommended her. Fifth is the lovely Catherine Howard, cousin of Anne Boleyn, but again childless and found to have been carnal with servants before and after her royal marriage, so also decapitated.

"James T. Hart is just entering his first year as a Harvard law student. Being a Midwesterner from Minnesota already makes him atypical from the Harvard stereotype. But typical of many of his fellow first year classmates, he is asked to join a study group, which ends up being six disparate individuals who may not be compatible beyond the fact that they are all aiming for success in their law studies which they equate with success in their future professional life. Although given a head's up by a colleague back in Minnesota, Hart is nonetheless ill-prepared for the reality that is the Contract Law class taught by the irascible and demanding Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. Beyond being academically bright, Hart also demonstrates that he has some level of street smarts in the deduction he makes in how to add a little extra insurance in how to obtain that elusive good grade in Kingsfield's class, if only there are enough hours in the day to obtain that continued level of insurance. Those hours are decreased when Hart embarks in a relationship with Susan Fields, a young woman he meets in town in an unusual circumstance. What ends up being their roller coaster of a relationship is largely directed by her unique perspective of what he is going through with law school in general, and Kingsfield's class in particular. As the year progresses, Hart comes to a changing perspective of Kingsfield, where Hart no longer just wants to get a good grade in the class, but also wants Kingsfield's admiration as he begins truly to admire Kingsfield."

Wise beyond her years, Addie picks up on Moses' grift, and very quickly, she and Mose become a team.

"Guy Debord's landmark cinematic analysis of consumer society is based on his influential sociological book ""La société du spectacle"" (1967). Debord was a leading member of the avant-garde art movement 'Situationist International'. This cinematic essay uses their method of 'détournement' to decontextualize and rearrange preexisting audiovisual materials and texts to critizise them and create new meaning. The result is a subversive collage of ideological (moving) images from socialist and capitalist societies that are presented here as artefacts of a global media 'spectacle': Social relations between people are mediated by artificial images and false representations that transform humans into mere passive consumers and 'spectators' of their alienated existence. Guy Debord's motivation was to create a radical social critique and a disruptive, anti-illusionist cinema as an antidote and revolutionary tool against the dominant cultural and sociopolitical forces of his time."

Hunting, he's fascinated by a mysterious cocky youth crossbow-sharpshooter who keeps outclassing them in tree-climbing--and keeps eluding his royal party. It turns out to be tomboy Popelka (Cinderella), whose stepmother shares nothing of the inheritance with her and has reduced her to being an unpaid servant at the lucrative estate manor. Cinderella's closest friend is her father's stallion, who helps her greatly, as do the wishes granted by three magical hazelnuts. When her stepmother and stepsisters cruelly crush her hopes to attend or at least watch the ball, she manages to intrude veiled and is followed how by the prince, who can't resist such an atypical hunt."

"Barton is a soldier in WW2 England; he meets Alice, who is looking after her farm single-handed as her husband is a prisoner of the Japanese. Barton stays overnight and they get friendly, and he decides to desert and stay with Alice. They become lovers. As a cover, she tells people in the village that her sister is staying with her, and Barton dresses the part. He has mixed feelings about the feminine role but evidently grows accustomed to it. Eventually an army sergeant comes to the farm, and is glad to learn that there are two unattached women there; he has sexual designs on them. Alice rebuffs him and he concentrates on Barton, as ""Cathy"". Barton is flattered by the attention, and foolishly agrees to go to a Christmas dance at the army base with the sergeant, obviously not realising that sexual activity will be involved, despite Alice's warnings. At the party, Barton realises what is developing, but can't escape, and the Sergeant won't take no for an answer."
"Sort of a cross between Love Story (1970) and an earthy Rembrandt painting, this movie stars Rutger Hauer as gifted Dutch sculptor Eric, who has a stormy, erotic, and star-crossed romance with a beautiful young girl. The story follows the arc of their relationship and his interaction with her family. Told in flashback form, initially, Eric is seen as a libertine lothario collector, taking trophies from his sexual conquests and pasting them in a book. He sees a sculpture he made of his lost lover and goes into a flashback of his relationship with his wife. He meets the girl, falls in love with and marries her, and we meet her parents: a charming, well meaning, bumbling father, and his shrew of a wife, who's convinced Eric is too much of a bohemian to make a good mate for her daughter. Eventually, the petty jealousies, the sexual hijinks, and the climactic vomit scene prove to be too much for the marriage, and Eric and his lady separate. Flash forward several months, and Eric finds the girl back in The Netherlands after an American sojourn. Their reunion is short lived. The somewhat melodramatic ending mirrors Love Story (1970)."

"This is a delightful, if peculiar, story of a day in the life of a small, Welsh fishing village called ""Llareggub"" (read it backwards). We meet a host of curious characters (and ghosts) through the ""eyes"" of blind Captain Tom Cat (Peter O'Toole). This is a true ""classic"" of modern British writing with a wonderful, mischievous use of language."
"In this comedy, set during the Nazi occupation of France, Peter Sellers plays most major male parts, so he stars in nearly every scene, always bumbling in inspector Clouseau-style. As British Major Robinson he is hidden in Madame Grenier's Parisian brothel, right under the nose of the Nazi clients, such as Gestapo agent Herr Schroeder (again him). As Général Latour he leads the French resistance, which includes the brothel madam -made a colonel in charge of her sexy 'troops'- and a priest, and is joined by young US diplomat Alan Cassidy. As Japanese imperial Prince Kyoto he becomes a target for the resistance in a monastery on his way to Hitler (again him). At the end he decorates the heroes as French president."

Eight acclaimed filmmakers bring their unique and differing perspectives to the 1972 Summer Olympic Games held in Munich. The segments include Claude Lelouch's take on Olympic losers and their struggle to remain dignified even in the face of bitter disappointment and defeat; Mai Zetterling's dramatic exploration of the world of weightlifting; and Michael Pfleghar's piece on young Russian gymnast Ludmilla Tourischev's majestic performance on the uneven bars.

"A surprise hit when it premiered, Walking Tall carried the theme of one man standing up for his sense of right and wrong. Selmer, a small town in southwest Tennessee, served as the authentic background for the bio-pic of the heroic southern Sheriff. Joe Don Baker did an admirable job with the role, and the hugely violent film was a surprise hit. Former Sheriff Pusser himself was set to potray himself in the sequel, but he died in a car crash as he as returning from his contract signing in California. The sequel was filmed using Swedish actor Bo Swensen, and a Final Chapter triquel told of Pussers' demise. While the Walking Tall franchise will never be on any list of Classic Film, the original is a great slice of Americana, Circa '70s. It made Bakers' career and perhaps kicked the 'southsploutation' genre of that decade into gear."

The film also features commentary by many African Americans who comment on how things were in Watts since the riots that tore the city apart seven years earlier."
"The often unlikely joint lives of Katie Morosky and Hubbell Gardiner from the late 1930s to the late 1950s is presented, over which time, they are, in no particular order, strangers, acquaintances, friends, best friends, lovers and adversaries. The unlikely nature of their relationship is due to their fundamental differences, where she is Jewish and passionate about her political activism both in political freedoms and Marxism to an extreme where she takes life a little too seriously, while he is the golden boy WASP, being afforded the privileges in life because of his background but who on the most part is able to capitalize on those privileges. Their lives are shown in four general time periods, in chronological order when they attend the same college, their time in New York City during WWII, his life as a Hollywood screenwriter post-war, and his life as a writer for a New York based live television show. It is during college that Hubbell finds his voice in life as a writer, and that Katie sees beyond his good looks to find a person with substance who realizes his position in a life as something that does not give him an inherent right to those opportunities. External world events, such as the Spanish Civil War, WWII and the House Un-American Activities investigation, do affect their lives directly, but it is how they deal with these effects personally, largely in relation to personal relationships - such as with Hubbell's long term friends J.J. and Carol Ann, the latter his college girlfriend - that may dictate if Katie and Hubbell are able to make it in the long term as a couple."

"It's sometime in the near future. Delos is an amusement park for the wealthy, where guests, for $1,000 a day, can live out their wildest fantasies in one of three resorts: Medieval World (recreating thirteenth century Europe), Roman World (recreating the height of the Roman Empire) or Westworld (recreating the 1880s Wild West). While the guests take on whatever role he or she wants, the resort-supplied ""actors"" filling in that world are all robots designed to be realistic to the actual beings, they programmed to fulfill the pleasures of the guest, whether that be as a friend, very good friend, or foe, with guests guaranteed that ""nothing can go wrong"" in that no harm can come to themselves, anyone else or the robots, on which routine servicing is conducted to rise again to fulfill the same or different role. Escaping the realities of a divorce, Peter Martin is a first time guest at Westworld with his friend, John Blane, a second time visitor who tries to reassure novice Peter. Slow to embrace the game and role playing aspect of the park, Peter eventually receives the rush he so desired when he ""kills"" a dark clad adversary at a saloon, that dark clad figure who he discovers is assigned his enemy in encountering him again. During Peter and John's stay, the technicians find that some robot malfunctions are occurring, the effects to the guests minor in nature, with John the victim of one of the more serious offenses. However, those minor incidents turn into major ones where the robots begin to malfunction to the point of taking control, with the dark clad gunslinger, equipped with some of the more high tech sensory mechanisms, after Peter to duel to the death."

"On Sunday, April 29, 1973, Sergeant Neil Howie with the West Highland Constabulary flies solo to Summerisle off the coast of Scotland. He is there to follow up on a letter addressed specifically to him from an anonymous source on Summerisle reporting that a twelve year old girl who lives on the island, Rowan Morrison, the daughter of May Morrison, has long been missing. The correspondence includes a photograph of Rowan. Upon his arrival on Summerisle, Howie finds that the locals are a seemingly simple minded lot who provide little information beyond the fact that they know of no Rowan Morrison and do not know the girl in the photo. Mrs. Morrison admits to having a daughter, seven year old Myrtle, but no Rowan. As Howie speaks to more and more people, he begins to believe that Rowan does or did live on the island, but that the locals are hiding their knowledge of her. He also begins to see that the locals all have pagan beliefs, their ""religion"" which centers on procreation as the source of life. That procreation does not necessarily need to be within marriage, and openly flaunts the act of sex, both in private and in public. These beliefs do not sit well against Howie's strict Christian morals, he who regularly attends church, prays, and accepts communion. Everything that happens on the island seems to be dictated by Lord Summerisle, whose ancestors bought the island generations ago. Howie begins to believe that Rowan was murdered, she a sacrifice by the islanders to their higher power to ensure a bountiful apple crop - the main crop of the island - which did not materialize last season. With May Day approaching, Howie not only tries to find out if Rowan was indeed murdered/sacrificed, which includes trying to locate her body, but if there will be another sacrifice on this important day within the cycle of life."

"2293. Zardoz, an unseen ""God"" who speaks through an idol, a large stone statue of a head, leads a barbaric race called the Brutals, who live a harsh existence in the Outlands. Zardoz tells the Brutals that once they die, they will be transported to the Vortex, where they will live happily as immortals. He has armed a small group, the Exterminators, with guns, as Zardoz's philosophy is that killing is good, and procreation is the root of all that is bad. In reality, Zardoz is Arthur Frayn, from a competing, more advanced race, called ""the Eternals"", who live in paradise in the Vortex. The Eternals truly are immortal as they do not age and their bodies undergo reconstruction if they ""die"". As such, they truly do not believe in procreation as their society has reached perfect equilibrium. Past human acts such as sex and sleep are obsolete in their advanced state. All major decisions are achieved through pure democracy. The Eternals, however, are not immune to non life threatening disease or sin, the latter which is punishable by aging, only making their life less pleasant, but not ever killing them. Arthur's mission as Zardoz is to control, monitor, and study the Brutals for the Eternals. Being in the Outlands, Arthur is isolated without communication back to the Vortex and the Eternals. In his work as an Exterminator, Zed, by accident, is able to find his way to the Vortex as a still alive being. The Eternals vote to keep Zed alive temporarily so that they can study him before they kill him. Amongst the Eternals who have direct interactions with Zed are: May, the lead scientist, who believes Zed is a blessing in that they have not had access to a Brutal in some time; Friend, a hedonist who wants to use Zed as the animal he considers him to be; and Consuela, the hard lined one who believes in vigilante justice. In the Eternals' access to Zed, they may learn if he making it to the Vortex was indeed an accident. In addition, their so-called Utopian society may be exposed for what it truly is."
"Fritz Haarmann, aka the Butcher of Hanover and the Vampire of Hanover, was a German serial killer responsible for the murders of two dozen boys and young men during the so-called 'years of crisis' between the wars. His case would partly inspire Fritz Lang's M, and its central character portrayed by Peter Lorre, as well as this forgotten gem from 1973. Tenderness of the Wolves treats the viewer to a few weeks in the company of a killer. Baby-faced and shaven-headed, in a manner that recalls both M and F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu, Haarmann is a fascinating, repulsive figure. Using his status as a police informant to procure his victims, he dismembers their bodies after death and sells the flesh to restaurants, dumping the remainder out of sight. This isn't an easy film to watch, but it certainly gets under the skin - Produced by Rainer Werner Fassbinder (who also supplies a shifty cameo), Tenderness of the Wolves provided two of his regular actors with a means of expanding their careers. Ulli Lommel - later responsible for the infamous video nasty The Boogeyman - made his directorial debut, while Kurt Raab wrote the screenplay as well as delivering an astonishing performance as Haarmann."
"In Uruguay in the early 1970s, an official of the US Agency for International Development (a group used as a front for training foreign police in counterinsurgency methods) is kidnapped by a group of urban guerillas.

It's a fight to the death with gang members winding up at the bottom of the river encased in cermet foot-ware, chewed up by the garbage detail, bombed out or machine gunned down. They import help. Uncle Frank hires profession killer Harry Crown (Richard Harris) and pays him 100 G's to rub out Big Eddie, and the latter sends for Marvin ""Claw"" Zuckerman (Chuck Connors), a sadistic and demented killer, who is one hand short of having two hands. And Marvin hates Harry because it was Harry who cut off his hand when Marvin savagely mistreated a girl. In between all the blood and bullets, there is time for romance. Harry resumes an affair with Buffy (Ann Turkel), a third-grade schoolteacher (school-class status and not a rating), and Tony (David Hall), a hotshot young gangster assigned by Uncle Frank to assist Harry, becomes involved with Baby ((Katheine Baumann), an innocent-looking young hooker. Baby works at a most unusual whorehouse, ""Dolly's Incorporated"", which is located high above the city in a skyscraper, and ran by Dolly (Constance Ford).

But the deplorable Marvin kidnaps Baby when she goes back to Dolly's to collect her things.

"Despite admitting that she was scared of him in her never-ending quest to please him, thirty-five year old housewife and mother Alice Hyatt is devastated when her husband Donald is killed in an on the job traffic accident. With few job skills except that as a singer, Alice, along with her precocious eleven year old son Tommy, decides to move from their current home in Socorro, New Mexico to her home town of Monterrey, California, the only place she has ever felt happy. She plans on getting singing gigs along the way to earn money to get back to Monterrey by the end of the summer and the start of Tommy's school year. Alice's quest for a job at each stop leaves Tommy often to fend for himself, which may make Tommy even more precocious. His behavior is fostered by Alice, as their relationship is often more as trouble-making friends than mother and son. Alice's plans often do not end up as she envisions, especially as she is forced to take a waitressing job at Mel and Ruby's Diner in Tucson, Arizona, which entails working with a disparate group, including Mel, the establishment's gruff owner/short order cook, and her fellow waitresses, the wisecracking, foul mouthed Flo, and the naive and shy Vera. Alice also falls into old habits, namely relying on men to make her feel fulfilled, specifically the much younger Ben, and farmer David. Those relationships may also provide her with a better perspective on her life and her bad choice of Donald as a husband."
"One year in a small northern Italian coastal town in the late 1930s is presented. The slightly off-kilter cast of characters are affected by time and location, the social mores dictated largely by Catholicism, and the national fervor surrounding Il Duce aka Benito Mussolini and Fascism. The stories loosely center on mid-teen Titta and his household, including his adolescent brother, his ever-supportive mother who is always defending him against his father, his freeloading maternal Uncle Lallo, and his paternal grandfather who slyly has eyes and hands for the household maid. Other townsfolk include: town beauty Gradisca, who can probably have any man she wants but generally has none as most think she out of their league; Volpina, the prostitute; Giudizio, the historian; a blind accordionist; and an extremely buxom tobacconist. The several vignettes presented include: the town bonfire in celebration of spring; life at Titta's school with his classmates and teachers; Titta's father Aurelio at his beachfront construction worksite and his and his workmates' encounter with Volpina; Titta's confessions to the priest about his burgeoning sexuality; Aurelio being questioned by authorities about his anti-Fascist leanings; a fantasy sequence at the luxurious Grand Hotel; a family outing with Aurelio's institutionalized brother Teo; many townsfolk embarking on a sail to witness a marine event passing by their town; an annual car race; Titta's fantasy encounter with the tobacconist after closing hours coming true; events surrounding the big snowfall that year, including a family tragedy; and an event centering on Gradisca and her future."
"The wildly prolific German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder paid homage to his cinematic hero Douglas Sirk with this update of that filmmaker's All That Heaven Allows (1955) . A lonely widow ( Brigitte Mira ) meets a much younger Moroccan worker ( El Hedi ben Salem ) in a bar during a rainstorm. They fall in love, to their own surprise-and to the outright shock of their families, colleagues, and drinking buddies. In Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, Fassbinder expertly wields the emotional power of classic Hollywood melodrama to expose the racial tensions underlying contemporary German culture."
Hilarious documentary on the wildlife of the Namib Desert.
"Surya, the son of a wealthy landowner, returns home from the city after graduating from school and is expected by his father to get married and take over a piece of land. He settles in not without conflict with the other people from the village, whose traditions he does not share. He uses his position to begin a love affair with Laxmi, who is unhappily married to a deaf-mute drunk. When Laxmi is left by her husband, Surya invites her to live at his house, much to the disdain of everybody else, who see this as a breach of the caste system. Their love affair ends abruptly when Surya's wife arrives. Rather than keeping to his promises, Surya drives Laxmi out of the house; when it turns out that she is pregnant, she suddenly becomes a threat that must be disposed of. The final scene of this movie raised many eyebrows upon its release in 1973, as it was seen as a disquieting symbol of rebellion against the country's social structures. Shabana Azmi's compelling performance as Laxmi laid the foundation for her becoming one of the great actresses of the independent Indian cinema of the 1970s and 80s."

Lennie receives all the positive attention from family and others of authority in the neighborhood, especially from Max's businessman brother, their Uncle Benjy, who is financing Lennie's medical school education, while Duddy is on the most part neglected. The only elder in the family and in the neighborhood who shows Duddy any respect is their zaida. As such, Duddy aspires to his zaida's assertion that land ownership is the way to make a name for oneself, especially after Duddy finds a lake, the entire property around which he would like to purchase. With only his ingenuity and chutzpah at hand, both of which he has plenty, Duddy embarks on one get rich scheme after another to make money to buy the land, usually following the belief that doing favors for those in power will yield financial favors in return. By Duddy's side through many of these schemes is his French-Canadian Catholic girlfriend Yvette, who loves Duddy but hates how he reduces his affections for her to economic terms. Yvette stays with Duddy despite the probability that there is no long term future for them due to their religious differences. The primary questions become whether Duddy's high risk ventures will ultimately result in his end goal of being able to buy all the land, whether this goal is worth it at any cost, whether he will garner respect from his family and the community, and whether he will find true happiness and ultimate fulfillment in achieving these."

"On the evening that the Pi Kappa Sigma sorority (which is headed by their house mother, the booze swilling Mrs. Mac) is holding their Christmas party, the house receives the latest in a string of obscene phone calls from who the girls call ""the moaner"", but who identifies himself as ""Billy"". Some like Jess Bradford don't like the calls, others like brash Barb Coard are somewhat amused by the calls, others like Phyl Carlson don't think much of them, and straight laced Clare Harrison is offended by them. The calls are just the latest trouble for Jess, who is pregnant and who doesn't want to tell her sensitive but volatile boyfriend, music student Peter Smythe. For this latest call, which is a bit more elaborate than those previous, Barb decides to make a snide comment in return, which provokes a threat by Billy. The next morning, one of the girls goes missing. The desk sergeant at the police station doesn't think much about this as a missing person case, especially as the police are already dealing with another missing person case (a thirteen year old girl named Janice Quaife). The police don't act until more information is brought to the attention of Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller by Clare's boyfriend, Chris Hayden. As Lt. Fuller and his men investigate, which includes placing a wire tap on the sorority house phones, more and more incidents happen to those living at the sorority house. In addition, the obscene calls continue and increasingly have a personal connotation to one of the girls, which includes information that could only be known by those involved.

"It's 1874 in the American frontier of the wild west. Because of geological problems, a railroad under construction needs to be rerouted through the town of Rock Ridge, where general lawlessness prevails, that lawlessness which led to the town sheriff being murdered. Upon learning this information from Taggart - the railroad construction boss and secretly his right hand man - Hedley Lamarr, the state attorney and assistant to hapless Governor William J. Le Petomane, senses an opportunity to make millions by acquiring as much property in Rock Ridge as possible before the news of the railroad gets to residents of the town which would encourage them to stay despite the lawlessness. Hedley's ultimate plan, which he has to devise upon learning that the residents have decided to stay and which he is able to enact, is to get the Governor to appoint a new sheriff - the town elders having asked him to do so - so offensive to the townsfolk that they will voluntarily leave town without any prompting. Hedley's choice of that new sheriff is a man named Bart, who was part of the railroad construction gang, and who Hedley was going to hang on Taggart's initiative solely because of an antagonistic encounter between the two. The reason why Bart would be so offensive to the townsfolk?: he's black. Unlike most of the white men on the construction crew who are uncouth and backward, Bart is an urbane intellectual. With the help of Jim, one of the town's drunks whose drinking hides his much different past, Bart is able to win over most of the townsfolk by using his intellect. As such, Hedley, with Taggart by his side, uses one tactic after another either to discredit or kill Bart, who eventually is able to figure out Hedley's scheme for the town. What eventually happens in the standoff is affected by some twentieth century Hollywood mentality and goings-on."

"Udo Kier is without a doubt the sickliest of vampires in any director's interpretation of the Bram Stoker tale. Count Dracula knows that if he fails to drink a required amount of pure virgin's [pronounced ""wirgin's""] blood, it's time to move into a permanent coffin. His assistant (Renfield?) suggests that the Count and he pick up his coffin and take a road trip to Italy, where families are known to be particularly religious, and therefore should be an excellent place to search for a virgin bride. They do, only to encounter a family with not one, but FOUR virgins, ready for marriage. The Count discovers one-by-one that the girls are not as pure as they say they are, meanwhile a handsome servant/Communist begins to observe strange behaviour from the girls who do spend the night with the Count.

"It's the early 1930s. Working their way up the ladder largely on chutzpah, Roch Sifreddi and François Capella, who became best friends in their unlikely partnership, have risen to the top of the organized crime world in Marseilles. Shortly after reaching the top, Capella is murdered. Sifreddi eventually learns that the murder was orchestrated by international businessman Giovanni Volpone, new to Marseilles from Italy, whose ultimate goal is to take control of the city in all aspects--legal and illegal. While Sifreddi sees Volpone's action as the start of a gangland war, Volpone has other thoughts in sending a longer-lasting message to Sifreddi and others who may want to fill his shoes. Volpone has specific reasons for wanting Marseilles--a war he will want to wage in most of the western world to reach his end goal. Standing by Sifreddi in this war is Lola, a former prostitute friend to both Sifreddi and Capella, who was Capella's girlfriend at the time of his death, and Sifreddi and Capella's loyal and long-serving head henchman, Fernand. In this battle, Sifreddi can no longer rely on the hands-off approach by the police, former Commissioner Fanti, who would only intervene if the tit-for-tat killings got out of hand. Fanti has now been replaced by Commissioner Cazenave, who is a little out of his element in dealing with such matters. Under the circumstances, the police may have their own ideas of what they would like to happen with Sifreddi and Volpone's war, especially as Volpone views the law as only applying to poor people."

"Separated into four independent short stories, this erotic anthology comprised of tantalising tales about sexual desire and its diverse manifestations, intertwines the omnipotent human urge with the fervour of desire, curiosity and self-exploring, the forbidden with the obscene. Unapologetically, it attempts an insight, other times superficially and other times with a more comical approach, into subjects such as teenage virginal naiveté and the farewell to childhood in the first segment titled ""La Marée (The Tide)"", while in the following part named ironically ""Thérèse Philosophe"", a curious teenage bourgeois girl surrenders to the delights of erotic self-stimulation and philosophy. Next, in the blood-drenched vignette named ""Erzsébet Báthory"", the vanity of youth and the chase for immortality is explored through the legend of the murderous Countess Elizabeth Báthory and her vampiric tendencies involving the bright-red and warm virginal blood. Ultimately, in the final segment titled ""Lucrezia Borgia"", the outrageous and scandalous act of incest is vividly depicted including the infamous Lucrezia Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI, and her lustful Cardinal sibling Cesare Borgia."

Harry used to be detached from what he recorded, but is now concerned ever since the deaths of three people that were the direct result of a previous audio recording he made for another job.

"It's the late nineteenth century. Annie Miller, more regularly referred to as Daisy, of Schenectady, New York, is on a grand tour of Europe with her mother, Mrs. Ezra Miller, her precocious adolescent brother, Randolph Miller, and their manservant, Eugenio. It is at their stop in Vevey, Switzerland that Daisy meets Frederick Winterbourne, an American expat studying in Geneva. Frederick has mixed emotions about Daisy. On the one hand, he is captivated by her beauty. On the other, he believes her to be uneducated and improper in her modern American attitude and behavior, she basically doing whatever she wants regardless of the possible perception of impropriety by those in Frederick's social circle. That latter view is shared by Frederick's aunt, Mrs. Costello, with who he is traveling. Conversely, Daisy finds Frederick to be stiff. Regardless, Daisy does allow Frederick to spend time with her as they move from Vevey to Rome, Italy in their individual parallel travels. Through this time, Frederick becomes more torn about Daisy, especially as she is not averse to flirting with Mr. Giovanelli, who she meets in Rome, she preferring to walk on the arms of both Giovanelli and Frederick at the same time in public. That torn feeling is exacerbated by the talk of others, especially judgmental Mrs. Walker who is not averse to using her social standing to exert her will on others. That mixed feeling is also in that Frederick is unaware if Daisy's behavior is truly and knowingly improper and hurtful to those around her, or if she is only an innocent in her joie de vivre. He may ultimately get his answer, but by that time it may be too late for him to express his true feelings for her in return."

He comes from a peasant farming family, his father who is currently a POW, while his mother, with the help of laborers, operates the farm. On his latest visit home, Lucien, who has no political or nationalistic inclinations, makes attempts to join the Resistance as he does not want to return to his nursing home job in the small nearby town. He is turned down largely because of his age. As such, he is easily co-opted to join the Gestapo instead when the opportunity arises by chance, even after he sees the brutality often exacted by his new colleagues, that brutality by which he is largely unaffected emotionally, even if it is against people he knows. He seems to be motivated by money to help his mother, and the other favors he can provide through the Nazis' position of power. His association with the Nazis is despite warnings from some that the end of the war is near, the Americans who will ultimately liberate France from the Germans. Lucien's life, and that of the others involved, becomes more complicated when he falls for France Horn, the daughter of local tailor, Albert Horn. The issue is that the Horns are Jewish. Lucien may have to make a decision between his allegiance to the Nazis versus his feelings for France. Conversely, the Horns have to decide how to deal with Lucien, whose association with the Nazis they naturally abhor, and who they may not be able to refuse or deny as he is the one wielding the gun, regardless of what they feel for him as an individual. France's actions may also be driven by her feelings of being Jewish, a peoples who seemingly are repressed on all sides."

"Both trifles and structure are tossed out the door by director Ken Russell in this film. Here, historical content matters less than metaphors, feelings, emotions, and interpretations. Pay close attention, as every word and frame is intended to be important. The film takes place on a single train ride, in which the sickly composer Gustav Mahler and his wife Alma confront the reasons behind their faltering marriage and dying love. Each word evokes memories of the past, so the audience witnesses events of Mahler's life that somewhat explain his present state. Included are his turbulent and dysfunctional family life as a child, his discovery of solace in the ""natural"" world, his brother's suicide, his (unwanted) conversion from Judaism to Catholicism, his rocky marriage, and the death of their young child. The movie weaves in and out of dreams, flashbacks, thoughts, and reality as Russell poetically describes the man behind the music."

When Lightfoot brings up the topic of robbing a bank, Thunderbolt's true history comes to light: he's a bank robber whose last job netted five hundred thousand dollars still hidden where only he of the surviving team members knows. The media reported that the money had been recovered, which, in reality, was a sting operation by the Police to draw out the robbers. It, however, led to Thunderbolt's accomplices believing he double-crossed them, hence the reason they now want him dead. Thunderbolt and Lightfoot learn that recovering the money may be a difficult task at the same time that two of Thunderbolt's old team members, Eddie Goody (Geoffrey Lewis) and Red Leary (George Kennedy), who are out to kill him, also learn the truth that the money was never recovered, and that Thunderbolt did not double cross them. In light of these new circumstances, Lightfoot believes he has an ingenious plan which requires the assistance of the old team, which, if successful, would make them all rich. Will the magic happen this second time around with Lightfoot added to the mix? And will old and new allegiances hold fast through to the completion of the scheme?"

After all the customers have left and the bank is about to close, they proceed to rob it at gunpoint. But the robbery does not go according to Sonny's plan. There is little cash as the money has been picked up for the day. Stevie abandons the plan and flees. A standoff ensues between the robbers (locked inside with ten hostages, the male bank manager, the male security guard, and eight female tellers and clerks) and the police, the media, and a hoard of onlookers outside. Sonny and the far less exhibitionistic but seemingly even more unstable Sal have a suicide pact if things go wrong but Sonny tries to negotiate a way out, realizing the hostages are the duo's only leverage. As Sonny deals with the authorities - primarily ""good cop"", NYPD Captain Moretti, who tries to give Sonny whatever he wants, and ""bad cop"" Sheldon, an FBI agent who plays hardball with Sonny, the public (watching the interactions and hearing news reports) has mixed feelings about what Sonny is doing. Some, especially a contingent of the activist gay community (who later turn out to support Sonny in person) are sympathetic. As the situation turns into a circus both inside and outside the bank, emotions are ratcheted up a notch when Sonny's ""second wife"", Leon, is brought to the scene from a hospital following a suicide attempt by drug overdose.

Later, Sonny and Leon have, by turns acrimoniously and affectionately, a phone call, mostly acrimonious in that Leon rebukes Sonny for his actions, tells him they will not be travelling together [to Algeria, which Sonny has decided will be his escape destination), and blames Sonny for the cops thinking he [Leon] is an accessory. Soon after, Sonny calls his legal wife, with whom he has two children, and the reasons for that marriage's failure become evident. Sal is upset because the news reports have referred to the robbers as ""two homosexuals"". As long day turns to night, the standoff continues until the inevitable bloody (but minimally so) resolution. The audience learns, among other things, before the credits roll, that Leon (not the real life individual's name) did have the sexual reassignment surgery."

"Filmmaker Orson Welles discusses the issue of fakes purporting to be reality. He describes the range of fakes in life, which can be as relatively benign as his demonstration of having a beautiful seductively dressed woman walk down the street, her purpose, which most looking in from the outside would believe to get from point A to point B, but is in reality Welles' want to gage the reaction of primarily men to her by secretly filming them. He also discloses his own history with the issue, from his fascination with magic, to lying to get jobs, to the hoax that was his infamous radio program War of the Worlds. He focuses on three individual but somewhat interrelated and high profile cases. The first two involve Elmyr de Hory and Clifford Irving , the latter the former's biographer. Elmyr eventually came out as probably the most prolific art forger in the world. While Elmyr goes through his process, Irving muses on Elmyr's rationale in his work, his own reason for wanting to tell Elmyr's story, and how fake the biography is in light of Elmyr not being totally forthright in his own history. In Irving's own story, he is now most renowned as the hoaxster who purported to write Howard Hughes ' authorized memoir. It eventually came to light that Hughes had no involvement with the project at all. The third case, which brought about more than one issue of fraud, centers on artist Pablo Picasso 's fascination with a beautiful young woman he saw continually walking the streets of his hometown of Toussaint. In the presentation of these many situations, Welles brings up the philosophical question: if the fake is not discovered, is it real?"

"A fictional account of the events leading to the explosion of the German airship, the Hindenburg, while it was attempting to dock at Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 is presented. Such hydrogen-powered airships, built by Frankfurt-based Zeppelin, are flouted by the Nazis as a symbol of their global power, despite Zeppelin officials largely and openly not being Nazi supporters. Although the Germans have received crank reports of such before, they believe that a letter they receive from Kathie Rauch of Milwaukee stating that a time bomb will explode aboard the Hindenburg while flying over American soil to be genuine in its threat because of the specificity of her claims. As such, the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda, which corroborates that the letter's claims support their own intelligence, employs Luftwaffe Colonel Franz Ritter to act ""quietly"" as chief of security for the next Germany to US flight, when the explosion is to occur. The Nazis do not know that Ritter is not a supporter of their policies, he who would leave the German military if he could, but he does tell them that he believes such airships, even the Hindenburg, to be ""flying dinosaurs"". What the Nazis don't tell him but what he learns once on board is that the Gestapo have also enlisted an operative, Martin Vogel, for that flight, he who is undercover as the staff photographer. Ritter and Vogel are often at odds with each other on the approach to take on the process of identifying and dealing with a bomber. Although Mrs. Rauch is ultimately identified as a crackpot, Ritter does believe that there truly is a bomber on board, based on evidence he and Vogel collect of the disparate group of passengers and the crew, many of who seem to have the ability or motive to blow up the Hindenburg. What Ritter decides to do is based largely on his anti-Nazi feelings, but his actions may be compromised by Vogel's own strong Nazi leanings."

While he could simulate certain conditions in preparation on other mountains, he and his team could only visually inspect that segment of the mountain from a distance, it with pitches as steep as forty-five degrees which would propel him to speeds he would have never experienced on skis before, ninety percent ice to ten percent snow, and visible rock outcrops, the bottom of which was just above a deep crevasse. As such, this will be a one only attempt if that.

"This movie is about two ambitious ex-soldiers stationed in India who set out to become the rulers of an entire country. After finishing their tour of duty in India, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan have decided that India is ""too small for the likes of them"", so they decide to bribe a local ruler and extort money from him, in order to buy twenty Martini rifles, which they will use to take over villages in Kafristan. They face many challenges and perils along the way, including difficult terrain, hostile natives, freezing temperatures, and an avalanche high in the mountains. They eventually come to a small village, Urheb, where they meet Ootah and Billy Fish, an Indian who speaks English. He then becomes their translator. They then train the natives of this village to use the rifles, and soon conquer village after village. During a battle, Daniel is struck by an arrow that seemingly sticks out of his chest. The ignorant natives believe that he must be a God for not having died, and fall down and begin worshipping him. Daniel and Peachy decide that it would be easier for a ""God "" to take over the country, so they pretend that Daniel is a god, the son of Alexander the Great who has returned after two thousand two hundred years to again rule Kafristan. The entire country celebrated the return of their new ruler, the Son of Segunda (Alexander). As a token of their admiration, the holiest of holy men gives Daniel all of the gold and riches left by Alexander in 328 B.C. It is enough to make them the richest men in the world. All goes well until Daniel's ego and greed gets the best of him. He asks Peachy to bow when he walks in front of him. He later tells Peachy that he has decided to stay, and now believes that he is the son of Alexander (""in spirit, anyways""), and that to fulfill his destiny, he will marry Roxanne, like his ""father"" Alexander did before him. The Kafiri's believe that a mortal cannot marry a God, but Daniel goes ahead anyway. Peachy was set to leave with his share of the treasure, but Daniel convinced him to stay ""for old time's sake"" for the wedding. At the ceremony, Roxanne, believing that she would soon die, bites Daniel, drawing blood. The entire crowd realizes that since Danny is bleeding, that he is a man, not a God, and that he has been deceiving them the entire time.

They are eventually captured, and Daniel is forced to walk out on a rope bridge. The monks cut the ropes, and Daniel bravely falls to his death. Peachy is later crucified.

What he thought was his stable marriage to high-end antiques gallery manager Ellen Moseby is not, when he finds out she has been having an affair. Although she still loves Harry, Ellen believes his work - especially having to do all his own legwork in his independent agency, as opposed to working for a larger private investigation firm - is overtaking his life and their marriage. This revelation is bad timing for Harry as he starts on a new case, to locate two-week missing sixteen-year-old Delly Grastner for her mother, twice-divorced Arlene Iverson, a former bit actress.

Nicholson dreamed of skiing in the Olympics together, dependent next year on they doing well in the regionals which factors into who is named to the national team. Much is made in the press of a relationship between Jill and Buddy Werner , arguably the most accomplished male skier on the regional circuit from the rival team from Boulder, that relationship despite Jill being more attracted to Dick Buek, a proverbial hot dogger who is already on the national team but who is engaged to someone else.

There is only one rule for the race: there are no rules. The race was initiated and is organized by Mike and his twenty year best friend and competitor Steve Smith - Smitty - who will this year have as the seconds in their respective vehicles Samuel Graves, a Boston university tenure track Classics professor who is worried about getting caught which would threaten his tenure, and Italian race car driver Franco Bertollini, who arguably has the opposite sex on his mind more than the race.

"In the summer 1973, the coal miners working at the Brookside Mine, located in Brookside, Harlan County, Kentucky and owned by the Eastover Coal Company, voted to join the union, United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), against the wishes of Eastover administrators. Shortly thereafter, the miners went out on strike on Eastover and its parent company, Duke Power Company, refusing to sign a contract with its employees, union members. Beyond the direct economic issues of wages and benefits, the miners' grievances included long standing inherent problems with the coal mining industry in the United States in general, such as health issues most specifically with black lung from inhaling coal dust, and other more acute dangers, an explosion at Consolidated Coal's Mannington Mine in Farmington, West Virginia a few years earlier which killed seventy-eight of eighty-two people working in the mine itself at the time. The company was granted an injunction prohibiting the strikers from blocking vehicles from entering/exiting the mine site and from calling the replacement workers hired ""scabs"". Emotions on both sides ramped up as the strike progressed, with wives and other miner supporters joining the strikers on the picket lines, and the potential for violence, most specifically gun violence, becoming more blatant. Discussions of a no-strike clause as a possible item within a contract became the most contentious issue. But other problems within the UMWA, which led to an indictment for murder, and the UMWA's contractual relationship to the Bituminous Coal Operators Association (BCOA) would also be factors. But a tragedy would be the turning point in the divisive strike, which hearkened back to similar such struggles in the area during the great depression."

"Despite not knowing him, the world's most famous detectives can't pass up the offer of a ""dinner and murder"" invitation from wealthy Lionel Twain (Truman Capote). Each has no idea until their arrival at Two Two Twain who else will be in attendance. Those detectives are: amateur sleuths and New York City socialites Dick (David Niven) and Dora Charleston (Dame Maggie Smith), accompanied by their pet terrier, Myron; Belgian detective Monsieur Milo Perrier (James Coco), accompanied by his chauffeur, Marcel (James Cromwell); Shanghainese Inspector Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers), accompanied by his Japanese adopted son, Willie Wang (Richard Narita); frumpish Brit Miss Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester), accompanied by her invalid nurse, Miss Withers (Estelle Winwood); and San Francisco gumshoe Sam Diamond (Peter Falk), accompanied by his femme fatale sidekick, Tess Skeffington (Eileen Brennan). The dinner part of the invitation runs into problems due to the non-communication between Twain's blind butler, Jamesir Bensonmum (Sir Alec Guinness), and Twain's new deaf-mute and non-Anglophone cook, Yetta (Nancy Walker). On the murder side, the guests initially believe Twain will try to kill each of them. However, Twain eventually announces his rationale for the gathering: that one of the people at the dinner table will be murdered before midnight, and that Twain will consider himself the greatest detective if his guests, who are now trapped in the house until dawn, cannot figure out who committed the murder, that person also at the dinner table. If one does figure out who committed the crime, he or she will be the recipient of one million dollars and the exclusive rights to the story. So the guests anxiously await the stroke of midnight, with those still alive after that time trying to figure out motive and the opportunity to murder before the rise of dawn, and before the murderer has the opportunity to strike again on one or all of them."

"The Union Broadcasting System (UBS) is the floundering fourth place American network of only four. Howard Beale, the once popular news anchor for UBS, has seen his own declining fortunes of late. Personal problems have led to his performance slipping, which in turn has led to declining ratings. The network has fired him, effective in two weeks, the news given to him by the head of the network's news division and his long time friend, Max Schumacher. On his first broadcast following receiving this news, Beale announces on air that he will blow out his brains on the telecast in one week's time, and the reason for doing so. The network brass, incensed, pulls him off effective immediately, but Howard, stating he was drunk at the time over the news of his firing, pleads for one final telecast so that he can exit from news broadcasting with dignity. When on the broadcast Howard instead speaks candidly, emotionally and profanely about what he is feeling, Diana Christensen, the relatively new and ambitious vice-president in charge of programming, thinks that Howard is the panacea to all the network's rating problems as Howard is only stating what the public is feeling. She is interested in counter-establishment programming. With Max's blessing, she wants to hijack from the news division a television news show featuring Howard. Through this process, Diana tries to convince network brass to do what she wants not only with Howard's show but other counter-establishment programming, Max wants to preserve his reputation as a news man with integrity, and Howard tries to convince Max and Diana that he is imbued with messages from higher powers, which is making him seem insane to Max (who cares) and Diana (who cares only if his rantings from these higher powers increase ratings). Despite their differences in views, Max and Diana begin a September-May romance, which plays on Max's conscience as a faithful married man for twenty-five years and which Diana always refers to, as she does everything in life, in terms of a television show plot outline."

"At last, we're given the answers to the questions raised by the haunting 1967 Bobbie Gentry song of the same title. Eighteen- year-old Billy Joe McAllister is in love with Bobbie Lee, but her father refuses to allow her to receive gentlemen callers before she's sixteen. In the Mississippi Delta, in a time before the boondocks had seen television and indoor plumbing, a young man's fancy turns constantly to thoughts of love. Billy Joe is no different in this regard and his persistence is making it difficult for Bobbie Lee to maintain her virtue (the dog-earred issues of ""Torrid Romance"" don't help either). Perhaps an indictment of the artificial conventions of society, the film demonstrates the tragic consequences of a young couple's first awkward grapplings with love and sex. As Bobbie Lee says shortly after Billy Joe's lifeless body is dragged from the Tallahatchie River, ""What do I know of love... I'm only a child."" Yet, there seems little doubt that what she feels for the dead boy is love. Could he have loved her so well?"

"There are at least three narratives in this film. The first is a depiction of everyday life on a frigate bound for the Grand Banks: rigorous discipline and repetitive chores, with beautiful scenes of the vessel in rough weather. The second narrative is that of the extraordinary fate of the ""Crabe Tambour"" (played by Perrin), a character closely modelled on the real-life Pierre Guillaume (aug.11,1925-dec.3,2002), a headstrong French naval officer who served in Indochina and Algeria. In Indochina, he served in a ""Dinassaut"", a fleet of light vessels in support of the Army river strongholds; After Dien-Bien-Phu he was a main participant in the ferrying to safety of Vietnamese catholics fleeing communism. In 1961, Guillaume plunged head first into the Algiers ´´Putsch of the Generals''. The putsch fizzled, but Guillaume went on to join OAS, a clandestine paramilitary organization seeking to overturn the Fifth Republic and restore Algeria to the status of French territory. Guillaume was caught and tried, later pardoned. Through flash-back anecdotes, the film depicts some of these and other adventures. The third narrative is that of the personal story of the ''Commandant'' (a grade equivalent to US Navy Captain) played by Rochefort, a dedicated and competent naval officer with an unblemished record of devotion to duty - except for one instance, which ruined his chances of reaching the top of the Navy. The unspoken opposition-admiration between Perrin and Rochefort hinges on the different paths followed in a time of crisis, when honor and duty were at odds. The film is thus a meditation on what it means to serve in the military."

"It's winter in a small southern Norwegian town in the late nineteenth century. After years of struggling, Dr. Thomas Stockmann and his family - his wife Catherine, their young adult daughter Petra, and their two adolescent sons Ejlif and Morten - have returned to town after being away for five years up north, he now well respected and successful as the medical resident of the Health Institute at Kirsten Springs, where he is also a board member. He devised the springs and institute as a center of therapeutic benefits on his own, but developed it with his brother, the town mayor, Peter Stockmann, who is the board chair. They have reinvigorated what was the financially crumbling town. Peter takes credit for giving Thomas this air of respectability, something that has never been important to Thomas, who would rather be seen as a man of conviction in doing the right thing. In this respect, Petra takes after her father. Thomas often writes articles for the local activist newspaper, The People's Daily Messenger, as part of doing the right thing. The Messenger's editor, Hovstad, who is attracted to Petra, sees the mayor as part of a group of townsfolk in positions of power solely for their own benefit - an old boys' club. Thomas' latest article, not yet published and what he wanted to investigate during the springs' off season before tourists start arriving in the spring, concerns the water supply at Kirsten Springs. As he feared, in the board's decision to locate the institute's water supply in the cheapest site and in the process dismissing Thomas' original recommendations, the water is being polluted, contaminated by being located downstream from a tannery. Through the story, Thomas wants to protect the overall public health, and does not want to be seen as a hero or extraordinary in doing so. When Peter finds out about the article, he does whatever he can to quash the story, including fear mongering, intimidation and using the power of being both the mayor and the board chair. His primary concern is increasing the viability of the institute by increasing the number of visitors, while doing as little as possible to increase costs, fixing the water problem, which he is not convinced even exists, being cost prohibitive. Although not his direct motivation, Peter is not averse to ruining Thomas' reputation in the process, making Thomas an enemy of the public which would make it easier to protect his own interests even more."

"It is New Year's Eve. 1976. On a Greek island a party of bourgeois hunters comes upon a body, buried in the snow and miraculously preserved by the cold. By his uniform, he appears to be one of the thousands of partisans killed during the civil war and the hunting party, a group of the ruling elite, must now decide what to do with the body. When they disinter it, blood begins to flow from the wounds in the partisan's body and they carry it back to the lodge where the inquest begins.

Merging poetic metaphor and historic reconstruction each member of the hunting party views the body on the makeshift bier: the colonel and his wife, the businessman, the ex-prefect of police, now a publisher, the ex-partisan who is now a wealthy contractor, the politician, the film actress who collaborated with the Nazis, the royalist noblewoman - all are forced to give an account of their actions since the civil war. Finally, they dream their own execution by partisans but awake to find it was but a collective nightmare provoked by the dead body of the partisan.

James, a Catholic himself, is the one she can and does bring home to her parents to maintain the façade of being the good Catholic.

"From her adopted home of New York City, francophone Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman reads letters written to her by her Brussels-based mother on behalf of herself, ""Daddy, (Chantal's younger sister) Silviane, and the whole family."" The readings are set against extended moving images of New York City generally presenting a feeling of isolation in the images being stark in their overall context, as even when masses of people are presented, there is little interaction between them. Adding to the starkness is a sense of monotony, whether it be any collection of objects moving at one speed, or any background noise almost acting like white noise. Although there is an outward loving tone to the letters themselves, they also convey a sense of loneliness on Mme. Akerman's part, not only in the messages themselves, but the rather innocuous nature of the letters which are remarkably similar over time with only the ""names"" and specific details changed.

God wants Jerry to be his messenger, much like a present day Moses, to pass along to the human race that ""he"" has provided all the necessary components of a successful existence, and it is up to the human race to do with those components as they believe fit to reach that success.

"In Los Angeles, Moses Wine, who was part of the counter-culture of the late 1960s at UC-Berkeley, still has those radical feelings but no longer does anything about them. His wife Suzanne, who has transformed from a 1960s hippie to a 1970s new-ageist, divorced him when his law school background didn't materialize into the upper middle class liberal life she was expecting, she having sole custody of their two young sons, with Moses having visitation rights. Moses fell into work as a private investigator of the gumshoe variety, which usually doesn't cover his monthly child support payments. After not seeing her for ten years, Moses is contacted by Lila Shea, an old girlfriend from Berkeley, to do some investigative work on behalf of her boss, Sam Sebastian, the Southern California coordinator for the gubernatorial campaign of Congressman Miles Hawthorne. Lila felt Moses would be well suited to the job because of running within ""the"" crowd at Berkeley, even if only knowing the main players by name and reputation. Flyers have been circulating with a doctored photo of Hawthorne and Howard Eppis in a friendly embrace, Eppis who in the late 1960s was part of the California 4 - the other three being Michael and Wendy Linker, and Luis Vasquez - an anti-establishment group convicted of several counts related to their work against the government. While the Linkers are behind bars probably for the rest of their lives, Luis Vasquez is a free man working for the rights of Mexican laborers, while Eppis has been a fugitive ever since, the authorities who are still looking for him. The flyers, which contain extreme socialist rhetoric and an implication of Hawthorne welcoming Eppis' endorsement, have the potential to derail Hawthorne's campaign. Moses is tasked with finding out who is behind the flyers - the most obvious being the campaign of Hawthorne's competitor, Senator Dillworthy - and if it is indeed not Eppis, why they would have specifically used Eppis' name. Moses accepts the job despite not endorsing Hawthorne - or Dillworthy for that matter - he equating Hawthorne's excitement factor to watching paint dry. The further Moses and Lila get into the investigation, the number of unanswered questions they have grows, and the more people who were associated with Eppis at the time cannot be located, including Oscar Procari, Jr., who funded the California 4's defense probably to spite his industrialist father. With the many trails, Moses and Lila still believe finding Eppis would answer many questions. All the while, Moses tries to rekindle a relationship with Lila. The investigation ends up having a change of focus with the potential for deadly violence on multiple levels and when incidents makes it personal to Moses."

"Probably without knowing it, Jimmy Angelelli is an emotional wreck of a man in being pulled in several different and often conflicting directions, some of those having to do with his parents and their control over him and thus his loyalty to them in return. One direction is in working for his loan shark father, mafioso Ben Angelelli, as one of his more effective collectors, Jimmy who, however, won't ever go as far as killing someone for not paying. Another direction is in his love for music, he being, like his institutionalized mother Ruth, a talented classical pianist - hence his nickname of Fingers - his love in that regard especially for Johann Sebastian Bach , whose Toccata in E minor he can play to perfection in the confines of his apartment. He plans to use that piece to audition for Ruth's old friend and colleague Arthur Fox to perform in concert at Carnegie Hall. His musical predilection however runs a wide gamut as he continually carries around a mini boombox to listen primarily to Motown tunes of the 1950 and 1960s, he playing his favorite songs as he wanders around his New York neighborhood, the tunes blaring regardless of the locale. Another direction is meeting what he deems his own physical needs in a sexual sense, which don't always mesh what his brain is telling him. This issue causes complications as he pursues Carol, an artist he spots in his neighborhood, she who has her own complicated existence especially as it concerns Dreems, a club owner. Jimmy's tightly wound existence has the potential to snap, the question being what form that trigger will be and how the snap will manifest in his life."

"Arthur Kirkland is a principled and dedicated Baltimore-based defense attorney. He stands up for what he believes in, and as such has spent time in jail for contempt for what he believed was the unfair treatment by the judge, Henry Fleming, for his innocent client, Jeff McCullaugh. It is thus well known that Arthur hates Fleming. It is because of that public knowledge that Fleming requests Arthur to be his defense attorney when he is charged with the violent rape of Leah Shepard. Due to circumstances, Arthur has no other option but to take Judge Fleming's case. As the case progresses, the judicial system around Arthur seems to be crumbling. His law partner, Jay Porter, is slowly falling apart due to the guilt associated with the actions of guilty clients for whom he got acquittals. Judge Fleming still seems to be stalling on Arthur's request to review McCullaugh's case, McCullaugh who is still in prison, where he has been beaten and raped. In dealing with other issues, Arthur asks another colleague, Warren Fresnell, to handle the probation hearing for another of his clients, scared transvestite Ralph Agee; however, unknown to Arthur, Warren is more concerned with his billable time than he is in doing his colleague a favor.

The dichotomy is that the limestone was used to build the university, which is now seen as being too good for the locals who built it. Although each of the four is a totally different personality from the other three, they also have in common the fact of being unfocused and unmotivated in life. The one slight exception is Dave. Although he has no job and doesn't know what to do with his life, he is a champion bicycle racer. He idolizes the Italian cycling team so much he pretends to be Italian, much to the chagrin of his parents, especially his used car salesman father, Ray Stoller, who just doesn't understand his son. Dave crosses the unofficial line when he meets and wants to date a IU co-ed named Katherine Bennett, who, intrigued by Dave, in turn is already dating Rod, one of the big men on campus. Dave passes himself off to her as an Italian exchange student named Enrico Gismondi. Beyond Katarina as he calls her, Dave's main immediate focus is that the Italian cycling team have announced that they will be in Indianapolis for an upcoming race, which he intends to enter to be able to race his idols. After an incident at the race, Dave, with a little help from his parents and unwittingly by actions of his friends, has to reexamine his life, what he really wants to get out of it and how best to start achieving it."

Jai agrees to do so, and plays successfully, though unknowingly to entrap a patriotic Indian named Nath (Jagdish Raj) who works for the government.

When the Indian police come to know of this, they assign the case to Inspector Vijay, who is asked to apprehend Jai at any cost. The only problem is that Inspector Vijay is Jai's look-alike, and is not at all a good gambler. After this Jai and Vijay's professional and personal lives get confusingly mixed up as Jai and Vijay both coincidentally are sent to Rome where Vijay is sent to retrieve evidence against underworld don Saxena and Jai is onto a money-making scheme where he would marry his rich girlfriend Mala (Neetu Singh) to inherit her money.

She has been sent to seduce Vijay and stop him on his mission to retrieve evidence against the underworld don Saxena and Jai is only more willing to have a little fun before he sets about on his latest money-making scheme."

"1855. Edward Pierce (Sir Sean Connery), a member of London high society, is really a criminal mastermind. He is determined to steal the twenty-five thousand pounds sterling of gold shipped once a month via train by the handling bank, Huddleston and Bradford, from London to Folkestone on the coast, where it is shipped to Crimea as payment to the English troops, who, along with their French counterparts, are waging war there against Russia. There has never been a successful robbery on a moving train, which is considered folly by the authorities. Because of the nature of the safe in the luggage compartment of the train where the gold is kept, Pierce believes the easiest way into the safe is to obtain copies of the four keys required to open the safe, the four which are individually entrusted to three key people, who cannot know that copies have been made. Two are kept locked in the offices of the railway despatcher; one is kept in an unknown location by Huddleston and Bradford President, Edgar Trent (Alan Webb); and one is kept at all times around the neck of the bank branch Manager, Henry Fowler (Malcolm Terris), an acquaintance of Pierce's. Pierce needs the assistance of several people to pull off the heist, he enlisting: his beautiful mistress, Miriam (Lesley-Anne Down), who hopes the gold will mean a future for the two of them together; Robert Agar (Donald Sutherland), a screwsman; Barlow (George Downing), his chauffeur; ""Clean Willy"" (Wayne Sleep), a young cat burglar; and Burgess (Michael Elphick), the railway's security guard in the luggage compartment, who he will need to bribe to cooperate. Getting copies of the four keys is no easy task in and of itself, let alone getting the gold off the train undetected if they are able to get that far. They may have to turn to Plan Bs or Cs if they find the situation changes, and/or improvise on the spot if something doesn't work. But the large number of disparate individuals involved in the heist and the complexity of the plan may make the operation collapse under its own weight."

"This first-rate, 100 minute biopic - among the apex of rock on celluloid - appeared as an unwitting tribute to Keith Moon when first issued in 1979.

Highlights include non-split screen footage from Woodstock (PINBALL WIZARD, SPARKS and SEE ME, FEEL ME), A QUICK ONE from The Rolling Stones Rock And Roll Circus, and spectacular footage of the band smashing their equipment, notably the (literally) explosive opening sequence from The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in 1967.

Colorful, action packed, and full of underdog spunk, this is exploitation movie-making with a populist sensibility."

"This is an epic and dramatic film about the social tragedy of the Spanish Revolution. It is a screen version of one of the most popular novels by Dimitar Dimov (190 -1966). The action takes place during the Civil War in Spain. The accidental meeting of British noblewoman Fanny Horn with Father Eredia, a Jesuit monk, reverses their destinies. The attraction between them is very strong, yet the monk is fanatically devoted to his faith. Influenced by his religious strength, Fanny Horn follows him to a place where a typhus outbreak is raging. Pena Ronda is a camp for typhoid patients. The conditions are horrible, and the death is creeping around them. The shadows of the terminally ill move silently amid the rusty barbed-wire fences and the hospital shacks while on the outside the people of Spain are being drowned in blood.

"The film follows the French Paris-Roubaix spring classic, notorious for the hellish paves or cobbled roads of the north ""which are no longer used for traffic but only for transporting cattle - and for cycle races"". We are there from the dawn preparations and rituals on the outskirts of Paris and through the rigours of the race with special focus on a number of prominent cyclists to the final outcome on the Roubaix cycle track - followed by the filthy riders taking their showers. There is also an eye for life among the spectators and the media event as such. The film alternates among different kinds of shot with a view to establishing the most suitable view of the narrative: shots from motorcycles, which are able to convey the motion of the race and provide close ups of the riders in the style of television cycle race reporting; fixed cameras stationed at strategically important points along the route, where viewers can watch riders passing in real time and thus gain a clear overview of the distance between the leaders and the main field: and the Olympian eye of the helicopter shots."

"Under the Turks' heavy thumb and the Ottomans' reign of terror in early-1820s Greece, the son of a klepht, fervent patriot and cleric, Gregorius Dikaeos Flessas, or Papaflessas, was the selfless revolutionary--who, in complete disregard for his own life--was arming the enslaved Greek ""ragiades"" with the will to fight for the cherished and long-awaited freedom. Ordained to the highest rank in the clergy, that of Archimandritis, Papaflessas was able to move freely in the region of Moldovlachia--and as a member of the secret organisation, Filiki Eteria--he played a key role in preparing the ground for a nation's imminent uprising to gain its independence. From the commencement of the revolution on March 25, 1821, to his heroic fall on May 20, 1825, in the Battle of Maniaki against Ibrahim Pasha's brutal multitudes, Papaflessas will always be remembered as a hero in the everlasting pantheon of Greece's immortals."

The fruit of a 'reckless' love is killed and the first genuinely powerful feelings between two young people betrayed. The makers of this dramatic and moving film (also remarkable for the superb performance of the actors) denounce the old-fashioned social prejudices and present lobe and faith in man as scared symbols, which everyone should treasure."
